Little bit Curious
I have been following these community and all the news about robotics and automation for quite some time. And I came to an understanding that China is the undisputed king in this fields, due to their expertise in manufacturing and R&D. But my question is that why other countries have not yet caught upto this trend like what are the reasons. Is it that the automation solutions are far too expensive for the companies to afford, supply chain issues, labour laws, government policies? what are the causes that despite the advancements in robotics and automation yet no other country is able to complete with china in the field of manufacturing and robotics?
This reddit community is filled with experts and hobbist from the robotics and automation field so i thought that it would be the best place to understand the real problems that has barred other countries from competing with china in the filed of robotics and automation.
I myself am a hobbist and am interested in the robotics and industrial automation field. From my understanding and views, in developing countries companies often want to automate but the higher initial cost of the equipments and a lack of skilled work force to be able to tackle any type of malfunction in the automation equipment has stopped companies from the mass adoption of automation and robotics.
And in developed countries they are more oriented towards more precise engineering and hence the equipments becomes so much delicate and costly. They are necessary from the precision manufacturing of certain parts but at the same time the other day today manufacturing there I think we don''t need that much precision and an eye for that precision is not letting the mass manufacturing to take off in the developed countries.
Many would tell me that yes automation is taking off in other countries too but I don''t think that those rate can match the rate in China. I may be wrong correct me if I am wrong. If anyone knows what are the reasons for the low adoption rate of the automation and robotics in manufacturing in countries other than china I would love to know those reasons too.

Atkinson , Meghan Ostertag and Trelysa Long | July 18, 2025 Downloads Report PDF Robots are the future. It is time for Congress and the administration to take a number of straightforward and affordable steps to boost U.S. robotics innovation and adoption. KEY TAKEAWAYS An array of technologies are improving and coming together to enable robotics to be a key “general purpose technology” for the next technology long wave. Robotics is a strategic industry the United States cannot afford to lose to China, which is making massive efforts to dominate the industry globally. Robotics will be a critical technology to improving labor productivity and wage growth. U.S. robotics adoption rates are anemic and are even behind China, a country with significantly lower labor costs. While U.S. innovators continue to deliver cutting-edge robotics breakthroughs, the actual production of industrial robots is now dominated by foreign competitors. The United States has no domestic foundries producing robots. China is making substantial efforts to dominate the global robotics industry. While ideally Congress should provide significant financial incentives to support robotics innovation and adoption, in that absence, there are still many steps it and the administration can take to boost U.S. robotics.

Compared with artificial intelligence (AI), quantum, blockchain, and all the other “cool kids,” it gets no respect. But that, thankfully, is changing. An array of technologies are improving and coming together to enable robotics to be a key “general purpose technology” for the next technology long wave. [1] If the United States is to move beyond its anemic levels of productivity growth, applying robotics to a wide assortment of physical tasks (not just in manufacturing but virtually every industry that involves assembling or moving “things,” including people) will be critical. Robotics is also now a key dual-use technology with important applications in both defense and commercial applications. Letting China win the robotics competition would be highly problematic, and as the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has shown, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is well on its way to global dominance in robotics. [2] As such, national robotics policies should focus on both supporting the development and global competitiveness of the U.S. robotics industry as well as the widespread adoption of robots across the U.S. economy. Other nations, particularly China, have developed and implemented robust national robotics strategies. The United States has not. The result has been extremely low rates of robotics adoption and a lagging national robotics industry. Congress needs to take action to change that. To that end, it has already taken a useful step with the implementation of first-year expensing for equipment investment (in the recent “Big Beautiful Bill”), which will lower the after-tax costs of robotics adoption. Ideally, Congress would pass a CHIPS Act-style bill with large ambitions and robust funding for robotics. But this report assumes that is for another day, given the fiscal challenges facing the federal government. Rather, it lays out a legislative and administrative policy agenda for robotics that has a low “price tag.” However, first, the report discusses why robotics is important, how the United States is performing, and what other nations are doing to support robotics.  National robotics policies should focus on both supporting the development and global competitiveness of the U.S. robotics industry as well as the widespread adoption of robots across the U.S. economy.  Note that this report does not address concerns about structural unemployment from robust robotics adoption. ITIF has done that in many other publications in the past. [3] Suffice it to say that this is not a valid concern. The scholarly literature, historical evidence, and logic show that while robotics applications will lead to some job loss (and as described herein, Congress needs to improve programs for dislocated workers), it will not lead to higher levels of unemployment. Other jobs will be created. What it will do is boost U.S. per-capita living standards by allowing the economy to produce more with the same number of workers. It will also enable the United States to more effectively compete in global markets because production costs will be lower. Why Robotics Matters While there is no hard and fast definition of robotics, the term generally refers to physical machines that can be programmed to perform a variety of different tasks, with some level of interaction with the environment and limited or no input from an operator. Some will argue that autonomous systems (e.g., drones or autonomous vehicles) are robots. For the purpose of this report, we will focus on more traditional robotics. Robotics technology has the potential to be the most important technology of the next half century. Improving productivity in many functions and industries that involve moving or transforming physical things will depend on much better and cheaper robotics technology. To be sure, robots are already driving productivity. But we have barely scratched the surface of their potential because of limitations in functionality and costs. There is no reason why robots could not pick up litter or clean streets and parks. They could prepare and deliver food in restaurants, provide room service in hotels, and clean buildings. Robots could operate forklifts in warehouses, stock shelves in stores, lay bricks, dig trenches, and, as they do in China, construct roads. They could pick vegetables, fruit, and other crops that currently require manual labor. They could reduce the cost of caring for the elderly, both at home and in assisted-living facilities. [4] They can improve mining and manufacturing productivity, particularly in assembly and transport functions.  Yet, as MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote, “Having ideas is easy. Turning them into reality is hard. Turning them into being deployed at scale is even harder.” That is why a national robotics strategy is so important.  Rather than think about robotics as discrete things—which they are—they are also in some cases platforms. The smartphone, enabled by Moore’s law and 4G connectivity, sparked an enormous number of applications, many or even most of which were not even thought of before 2006. Robotics, while getting better with both hardware and software (including AI) improvements, is likely to be the same, with our imagination as one key limit. The cost of implementing certain digital manufacturing technologies has decreased in recent years. As Mike Coast and Bob Lyscas of the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center (Michigan’s MEP) explained: In some areas like smart sensors or robotics, the cost has been reduced by as much as 80 percent even over the past three years; what was costing in the area of $750,000 three years ago might be closer to $100,000 today. That lower cost is accelerating return on investment (ROI). For a 150–200 person-size company, we’re seeing ROI within 1.2–2 years and on the larger size firms (200–500 employees) we’re seeing good ROI data in the two to five-year timeframe.” [5] Still, costs need to fall further, and ease of use, flexibility, and quality need to get better. Yet, as MIT roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote, “Having ideas is easy. Turning them into reality is hard. Turning them into being deployed at scale is even harder.” [6] That is why having a national robotics strategy is so important. The United States has a critical interest in accelerating robotics development and ensuring adequate robotics production. Adoption and Production: Where the United States Stands Like any production technology, both the manufacturing of robotics and its adoption are important. The United States lags behind on both. U.S. Robot Adoption Robots development and adoption are key to boosting productivity and living standards because they increase firms’ efficiency. As a study by Mayer finds, greater robot density in manufacturing is linked to higher output and, in turn, stronger gross domestic product (GDP) and better living standards. [7] However, despite this, the United States has failed to lead in the adoption and development of robots when compared with other nations. Indeed, according to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the United States was the ninth largest adopter of industrial robots in the world with 285 robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers in 2022—down from seventh place in 2017. [8] (See figure 1.) In comparison, South Korea ranked as the world’s largest adopter of industrial robots with 3.5 times more robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers—1,012 robots—than the United States. [9] Similarly surpassing the United States, Germany had 415 robots, Japan had 397 robots, and China had 392 robots per 10,000 workers. [10] Figure 1: Industrial robots per 10,000 manufacturing workers, 2022 [11] Moreover, controlling for wage levels, the United States performed even worse in robot adoption in 2022. When ITIF compared expected robot adoption rates with actual rates, the United States ranked 13th with just 70 percent of expected robot adoption given its manufacturing wages. [12] (See figure 2.) Meanwhile, at the top were East Asian nations with China adopting 12.5 times more robots than expected, South Korea adopting 8.5 times more, Taiwan 5.9 times more, and Singapore with 5.3 times more. [13] Figure 2: Actual robot adoption rate as a share of expected robot adoption rate, 2022 [14]  Only 8.3 percent of U.S. manufacturing industries’ firms, which benefit most from using robots, have actually incorporated robots.  The fact that the United States lags behind other nations in robot adoption and development is not surprising. While other nations have established national goals and strategies to support robotics innovation and adoption, the United States has established policies that tend to harm robotics adoption and innovation. For instance, an ITIF report finds that while some nations have proactive tax policies to incentivize robotics adoption, the United States offers less-generous tax treatment of capital expenditures, thereby disincentivizing investments in robotics. [15] These policies are partly because the Americans tend to be more concerned over robots taking over jobs, despite multiple studies finding the contrary. As a study by Lee and Sabanovic finds, cultural attitudes play a role in a nation’s robot adoption rate. [16] Corroborating this, an ITIF study also concludes that countries’ wage-adjusted industrial robot adoption rates are modestly positively correlated with the degrees to which countries’ residents believe more emphasis should be placed on the technology in the future. [17] As a result, the United States’ lack of support for robotics adoption and development has led to low robot adoption rates across industries. According to the National Science Foundation’s (NSF’s) Annual Business Survey, only 1.3 percent of firms in all industries have used robots as part of their processes or methods in the production of goods and services. [18] Meanwhile, only 1 percent of nonmanufacturing industries’ firms have incorporated robots. [19] Although higher, only 8.3 percent of U.S. manufacturing industries’ firms, which benefit most from using robots, have actually incorporated robots. [20] (See figure 3.) Fortunately, the rates of usage are slightly higher for key advanced manufacturing industries where higher output is most important, which could lead to higher global market shares. These industries include computer and electronic products (usage rate: 12.1 percent); electrical equipment, appliances, and components (usage rate: 9.1 percent); and aerospace products and parts (14.2 percent). [21] Nevertheless, U.S. industries’ robot usage rates are still quite low, leading to a low overall robotics adoption rate in the United States. Figure 3: Share of firms using robotics as part of their processes or methods [22] U.S. Robot Production Despite pioneering robotics, the United States does not lead the world in producing them, raising serious alarm. As with so many advanced technologies, the United States remains strong in research and invention but weak in manufacturing. While U.S. labs continue to deliver cutting-edge robotics breakthroughs, the actual production of industrial robots is now dominated by foreign competitors. Japan, for instance, accounted for 46 percent of global robotics output and 36 percent of exports in 2022. [23] The United States, despite its much larger economy, accounted for just 5.4 percent of global robotics exports. [24] That means Japan’s robot export intensity is roughly 20 times higher than that of the United States. [25] As such, the message is clear: America’s robotics know-how is not being matched by an ability to produce at scale. This is because the broader U.S. industrial ecosystem that’s needed to support large-scale robotics production remains underdeveloped. The United States does not have a single major firm mass-producing industrial robots. In other words, the United States has no domestic foundries making them. [26] As a result, Japan, Germany, and China are the main providers of critical robot components such as servo motors, speed reducers, and precision sensors. [27] Despite the United States hosting leading foreign robotics firms such as ABB and Fanuc, these firms do most of their advanced manufacturing elsewhere. [28] As a result, the United States ran a $1.26 billion trade deficit in robotics in 2022, exporting less than one-third the value it imported. [29] Moreover, even with its poor production compared with other nations, the United States’ flagship public-private accelerator, the ARM Institute, operates with just $30 million while China is investing $138 billion to expand its AI and robotics manufacturing base. [30]  The United States does not have a single major firm mass-producing industrial robots.  More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity also shows that the United States continues to depend on other nations for robots. Indeed, the United States exported only $169 million in industrial robots while importing more than 4 times that amount at $707 million in 2024. [31] Of the $707 million in imports, $237 million came from Japan, $148 million from Germany, $73.7 million from South Korea, $39.9 million from Mexico, and $29.7 million from China. [32] (See figure 4.) Figure 4: U.S. imports of industrial robots by country in 2024 [33] That said, the United States does have some robotics companies. Massachusetts-based Teradyne Robotics is a global leader in advanced robotics through its ownership of Universal Robots, the pioneer and market leader in collaborative robots, and Mobile Industrial Robots, a pioneer and top player in autonomous mobile robots. [34] This American leadership in two of the fastest-growing robotics segments is a significant asset to the nation’s robotics ecosystem, and Teradyne recently announced plans to open a robotics manufacturing and service center in the United States. [35] Productive Robotics, a California-based company, manufactures 95 percent of its parts domestically and produces multi-axis collaborative robots that help automate machining processes. [36] Ingersoll Machine Tools in Illinois developed the Master Print Robotic, which combines 3D printing and CNC milling in a single machine. The United States is also home to a vibrant ecosystem of robotics start-ups, thanks in part to its leadership in software. [37] And companies such as Rockwell Automation are global leaders in the services side of the robotics industry. These examples show that the United States still has the talent and capability to compete. But without a broader strategy to translate innovation into production, they remain exceptions, and fast followers in other nations can quickly replicate American breakthroughs and undercut U.S. firms on cost. If the United States wants to reclaim leadership in robotics, it must use policy to proactively incentivize robotics production. Other Nations’ Robotics Strategies and Policies As robotics and automation have become a critical technology among advanced nations, many countries have established comprehensive national strategies to support innovation and adoption in the industry, while others have adopted an ala carte approach to robotics policy, implementing research and development (R&D) incentives and workforce training programs in robotics. This section reviews the various robotics strategies employed to drive growth in both the supply and demand of the robotics industry. National Strategies Leading nations have increasingly deployed national robotics strategies as a comprehensive approach to catalyze the innovation and growth of robotics sectors. These strategies often involve a range of incentives, subsidies, and other programs designed to not only increase investment in robotics R&D but also incentivize adoption, a key challenge for many nations seeking to automate. Although complex to implement, a national strategy encompassing most or all elements of robotics growth is the most effective way to build a nation of robotics innovation. In 2014, Japan was one of the first nations to recognize the power of automation and robotics, establishing its goal to realize a “new industrial revolution driven by robotics.” [38] Shortly thereafter, the Japanese government announced its “New Robot Strategy,” an initiative from 2016 to 2020 focused on the adoption of robotics in key, low-productivity sectors, including agriculture, healthcare, and infrastructure. [39] In 2020, Japan launched the Moonshot Research and Development Program, which, although not solely focused on robotics development, places emphasis on the development of AI and autonomous learning robots. The program is investing $440 million in 10 technology goals through 2050, including AI robotics. Japan’s desire for greater automation stems from a necessity perhaps greater than that of any other country. Its rapidly aging population has placed pressure on its economy, leading to a shrinking workforce and a greater need for employees in the service and healthcare sectors. Thus far, Japan’s strategies have been successful. In 2024, it was the number one industrial robot manufacturer in the world, and had the fifth greatest robot density, with 419 robotic units per 10,000 workers installed. [40]  South Korea will invest $2.2 billion in service and manufacturing robotics through 2028, with the aim of deploying 1 million robots globally by 2030.  Similar to Japan, South Korea has enacted several iterations of its national robotics strategies, all of which have been successful in propelling Korea to the top of global robotics leadership. Beginning with its Intelligent Robots Development and Distribution Promotion Act of 2008, South Korea is currently implementing its 4th Basic Plan on Intelligent Robots, which was launched in January 2024 and will run through 2028. The plan is investing $2.2 billion in the robotics industry, specifically supporting the development of robotics for the manufacturing and services sectors. The plan aims to establish the K-Robot economy, expanding the industry’s global reach and deploying 1 million robots by 2030. [41] South Korea was the world’s number one adopter of industrial robots in 2024, with a robot density of 1,012 robots per 10,000 employees. [42] In Europe, the campaign for robotics innovation is underway at both the continental and national levels. Horizon Europe, the European Union’s innovation framework, has emphasized the need to develop Europe’s robotics industry. But unlike other countries, it has stressed the need for robots to be complements to humans, not replacements. The EU has allocated nearly $100 billion for this initiative through 2027, with funding going to several key focus areas, including robotics in healthcare, climate change technology, and agriculture. At the same time, the European Commission has provided $183 million through the end of 2025 for a robotics-related work program. [43] Despite these initiatives, the EU’s robot density is rather low, at about 219 robots per 10,000 workers. [44] Within the EU, several countries have developed their own national robotics strategies. Germany, France, and the Netherlands have all implemented individual national strategies with focuses tailored to their respective countries. Germany and the Netherlands are focusing their investments on service robot innovation for logistics and manufacturing, while France’s “Robolution” initiative concentrates on research more broadly, with a goal of establishing a network of robotics research centers. [45]  When it comes to robotics strategies, no nation has implemented one as comprehensive as China’s.  Other nations, such as India, Singapore, and Australia, have focused their national robotics strategies around select industries in which they have a comparative advantage. Singapore has launched its National Robotics Programme, focusing on incentivizing robotics R&D in three key sectors: healthcare, construction and infrastructure, and environmental services. [46] Similarly, India’s National Strategy for Robotics emphasizes leveraging robotics for economic development, with a focus on the agriculture, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors. [47] Australia’s National Robotics Strategy aims to increase automation, not only in traditional industries such as agriculture and manufacturing but also in natural resource-intensive sectors, including mining and marine industries. [48] However, when it comes to robotics strategies, no nation has implemented one as comprehensive as China’s. Since 2014, China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, has been seeking a so-called “robot revolution” by implementing multiple robotics strategies and outlining 11 key areas where it aims for more robotics innovation and adoption. These include healthcare, education, and energy. [49] China is currently on its 14th Five-Year Plan for Robot Industry Development, which complements its overall five-year development strategy, “Made in China 2025.” Within this strategy are the creation of regional innovation hubs and research institutes focused on robotics, as well as national, provincial, and local subsidies for research investment and adoption. Additionally, there are foreign direct investment incentives, such as attractive tax policies and state-backed venture capital funds, and support for the acquisition of already established advanced robotics firms in other countries. [50] This moonshot approach to robot development has been successful thus far, with China’s robot density having doubled over the past four years, increasing to 470 units per 10,000 workers, ranking it third globally. If China continues at its current growth rate, it will surpass South Korea for the world’s greatest robot density by 2026. [51] Tax Credits, Subsidies, and Grants Some of the most fundamental elements of a national robotics strategy include financial incentives for firms conducting R&D and manufacturing robots. These incentives often take the form of tax breaks, subsidies, and research grants awarded to firms that are recognized for conducting innovative work in the field. Several countries offer incentives such as these. In Germany, the largest robotics market in Europe, robotics firms benefit from their position within the EU, as firms are eligible for research funding from the German and EU governments. The EU has allocated $100 million to research funding in key technology areas, while the German government is offering cash grants for R&D support totaling €70 million, or $81.6 million, through 2026. [52] Additionally, Germany’s Research Allowance Act provides a 25 percent R&D tax credit to firms for up to €500,000 per firm for R&D investments. This R&D tax credit is not specific to robotics research, but robotics firms qualify. [53] R&D tax credits were the most widely used and economically significant policy device to support research activities in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2024. In the OECD, 34 out of 38 nations implemented some form of an R&D tax credit, reimbursing researchers with a portion of their research expenses after the fact. Portugal, Iceland, and the United Kingdom provided the greatest tax relief for R&D as a percentage of GDP. Several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UAE, provide additional subsidies for R&D explicitly conducted in the robotics industry. The United Kingdom, for example, has pledged £93 million, or approximately $125 million, to robotics R&D through its Industrial Strategy initiative. [54]  The Chinese national government has established a state-owned venture capital fund for robotics, AI, and other critical technologies, with the goal of $138 billion in capital by 2045. Provincial governments have also invested millions of dollars in robotics.  Rather than a specific national robotics strategy, Australia has a national Industry Growth Program designed to boost innovative technology industries, including robotics. This strategy also utilizes an R&D tax credit to incentivize investment in robotics, which ranges from 8.5 percent to 18.5 percent, depending on company size and R&D intensity. [55] Additionally, Australia has begun implementing a series of grants for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in one or more of the seven government-identified industry priority areas (including robotics). Grants can reach up to $5 million. [56] Unsurprisingly, the financial incentives offered by the Chinese government for robotics firms are substantial. The national government has established a state-owned venture capital fund for robotics, AI, and other companies operating in critical technologies, intending to raise $138 billion in capital by 2045. Provincial and local governments have also made a point to invest heavily in state robotics capabilities. Beijing announced a $1.4 billion robotics fund to promote the development of robotics technology, while Shenzhen announced a $630 million policy package to advance AI and robotics innovation, with individual subsidies covering up to 60 percent of a business’s total costs. [57] However, it is possible these values are inflated, as provincial governments are likely to curry favor with the national government based on the value of the incentives provided. [58] Regardless, even if exaggerated, these values are significant investments in Chinese robotics adoption. Research Institutes Research institutes are organizations focused on conducting specialized research, often in critical technology areas, including robotics. Institutes, especially those funded publicly, are key components in developing an innovation ecosystem, as they often conduct research deemed too risky for businesses and too specialized for universities, thereby filling the gap between the amount of market R&D investment and the socially optimal amount of R&D. Robotics research institutes are key to translating basic research into marketable solutions with an economic impact. Several nations have plans within their national robotics strategies to establish or expand networks of research institutions. India’s national strategy calls for a network of Centers of Excellences ( CoEs ) to be developed. These centers will undertake both foundational and applied research. For India, robotics represents a path toward economic growth and development; however, investment in the technology by the private sector is low due to the high costs of capital and training employees. The CoEs will benefit the Indian economy in two ways. For one, they will support the training of future robotics experts, thereby increasing the supply of trained professionals in the field and decreasing the future cost of hiring and training workers. Additionally, they will partner with private sector firms to conduct applied robotics research, thereby reducing the R&D costs for these companies. [59] In the UAE, Dubai Future Labs are publicly funded research labs that, like those in India, conduct research on the “pain points” of the robotics industry that are otherwise untouched by private firms, and work to turn basic research into applied research for product development. The Future Labs have been used to develop unmanned aerial vehicles for last-mile delivery and beyond-visual-line-of-sight drones. They are focusing on accelerating R&D in five areas, including robotics in production and manufacturing, tourism, mobility and logistics, extreme environments, and healthcare. [60] In addition, the Labs serve as a teaching facility and a working space for private researchers, who can utilize Dubai Future Lab’s facilities to test newly developed technologies using its state-of-the-art equipment. The Labs also act as teaching facilities with workforce training programs. Internships, fellowships, and Ph.D. programs are offered to young graduates, enabling them to work in labs under the guidance of experts in the field of robotics. [61] The Chinese government has also established research institutes and innovation hubs for robotics, following the model of the American system, Manufacturing USA. Like Manufacturing USA, China has established several public-private research institutes in critical technologies, including one focused on robotics. However, unlike the American system, China has centered all activities related to a specific technology, such as research institutes, companies, universities, and other research activities, in one location. For robotics, one of these locations is Dongguan Robot City. There, the robotics industry is a key player in the economy, and publicly funded research institutions play a central role in the economy. [62] Germany has also developed a robotics research institute similar to those in the UAE and India, while Japan and Saudi Arabia have each established public-private robotics partnerships, facilitating the transfer of knowledge and skills between establishments. One study finds the Japanese program to be highly effective in spurring robotics development. [63] Workforce Training Developing a strong robotics economy involves not just investment in R&D and partnerships with innovative firms, but also educated and capable workers. This makes adequate robotics education programs not a want, but a need. Several countries have established robotics training programs for students in schools and universities, as well as reskilling programs for post-graduate professionals. Saudi Arabia launched the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative in 2016, a plan aimed at transitioning the country away from its reliance on energy and oil and developing expertise in other areas of Industry 4.0, including robotics. Within this initiative, Saudi Arabia is emphasizing the importance of robotics education, particularly at a young age. The King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), an autonomous government organization dedicated to promoting science and technology, has introduced STEM education programs into the country’s educational curricula for students. Along with teaching students the principles of robotics, students are provided with robotics equipment and resources and offered classes in programming and engineering. The success of these programs is evident in the growing popularity of robotics competitions nationwide. KACST has also developed robotics training workshops and training centers to provide individuals with hands-on experience in robotics technology. [64]  Germany and Mexico, both manufacturing powerhouses, have seized the opportunity to leverage automation in factories, particularly in the automotive industry.  In Brazil, the focus has been on bringing robots to students and working adults, thereby increasing exposure and interest in the field. Universal Robots, a collaborative robot (cobot) manufacturer, has sold over 200 cobots to Brazil’s National Industrial Training Service, reaching more than 2 million students and professionals. Additionally, Brazil’s Social Service of Industry agency has purchased over 20 cobots for 7 to 17 year-old students in the federal state of Minas Gerais, increasing early exposure to robots and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields broadly. [65] Germany and Mexico, both manufacturing powerhouses, have seized the opportunity to leverage automation in factories, particularly in the automotive industry. This strong demand for robotics professionals has led to the development of hundreds of higher education robotics programs in both nations, with over 300 each. [66] Mexico also now offers federal scholarships to students studying in critical technology fields, including robotics. Adoption Incentives For many countries, including the United States, the reluctance of firms to adopt robotics and automation into their operating procedures is a significant hurdle to overcome. Consequently, it has become commonplace for governments to offer incentives to firms that adopt automation technology. Some nations have created incentives or programs specifically to encourage robotics adoption, while others have roped robotics in with other productivity-enhancing equipment, such as machinery and software. In Singapore, which already has one of the highest robot densities in the world, the government invested $60 million in 2024 alone to promote the adoption of robotics. The incentives offered through the program include the first-year full expensing of any prescribed computer or automation equipment, including robots, as well as the launch of Singapore’s RoboCluster initiative. [67] RoboCluster will partner robotics firms with industries that are seen to benefit most from automation, such as facilities management, and offer forums and workshops to foster trust between the public and robots, encouraging further adoption of robotics. [68] South Korea, which has the highest robot density in the world, has developed a range of policy tools to encourage the adoption of robotics technologies. First and foremost is the establishment of the Korea Robot Industry Promotion Agency, which is responsible for adjusting regulations and laws that restrict the expansion of the South Korean robotics industry, as well as creating and implementing incentives for adoption. [69] For example, firms investing in automation technologies are eligible to receive an additional tax deduction of up to 7 percent, depending on the size of the business. [70]  Singapore, which has one of the highest robot densities in the world, invested $60 million in 2024 to encourage the adoption of robots. This investment will finance the full expensing of automation equipment, as well as forums and workshops designed to foster trust between the public and robots.  Japan and Slovenia, meanwhile, offer accelerated depreciation to firms purchasing new equipment, including robotics, allowing firms to deduct a greater portion of an asset’s value earlier in its lifespan, incentivizing adoption. [71] In China, provincial governments have provided significant subsidies for firms to buy robots. For example, in 2018, Guangdong Province invested approximately $135 billion for machine substitution for firms. A similar program was instituted in the Anhui province, which offered approximately $86 billion to subsidize industrial upgrading for manufacturers, including the purchase of robotics. Once again, regardless of whether these values are inflated, it remains a significant investment in robotics innovation, and one that has led China to automate at a rapid pace. Additionally, the Chinese government offers subsidies for robot purchases, with the average subsidy amounting to 17.5 percent of the equipment’s cost. [72] In contrast, the United Kingdom, like the United States, has few incentives for the adoption of automation or robots. Both nations have less-generous tax treatment of capital expenditures and therefore exhibit lower levels of capital expenditures by manufacturers. [73] It should be unsurprising, then, that the United Kingdom has a robot density of 119 robots per 10,000 workers, a level that has been described as “very low for a Western European country.” [74] Policy Recommendations There are an array of things Congress and the administration can and should do to support the development and competitiveness of the U.S. robotics industry and the widespread adoption of robotics. This section lists a number of policy proposals. However, this section does not propose significant funding and tax incentives, despite the fact that, without them, it will be more difficult to secure a strong U.S. competitive position. Ideally, Congress would pass a machinery (including robotics) tax credit. Moreover, Congress would ideally appropriate tens of billions of dollars for robotics development and production domestically.  One reason for a more focused robotics policy is that scale and learning economies matter. For every doubling of robotics adoption, robotics companies reduce costs and, just as importantly, improve quality.  Ideally, Congress and the Trump administration would announce and support a national robotics moonshot initiative. Robotics is an ideal candidate for a moonshot because successful development requires advancement in a host of related technologies, including AI, machine vision, batteries, touch sensing, speech recognition, and others. And while there are many different kinds of robots for many different kinds of applications, one application that would be an ideal candidate for a moon shot would be a household assistance robot. Such a robot could help people, including the elderly, by doing tasks such as washing dishes, doing laundry, cooking, and cleaning. A national moonshot to support research that would lead to fully functionable and reasonably affordable home robots within a decade would be a truly transformative action. One reason for a more focused robotics policy is that scale and learning economies matter. For every doubling of robotics adoption, robotics companies reduce costs and, just as importantly, improve quality. This is particularly the case as more and more robots use AI, which relies on data. As such, without more scale for U.S. robotics producers, it is possible, and perhaps even likely, that the Chinese producers will attain an insurmountable advantage. However, back to the real world of budget limitations and disinclinations of both parties to spend on technology development and adoption, there are still an array of policies Congress and the administration can take. These include seven major areas: Better Data, Analytics , and Evidence The United States government needs enhanced capabilities to better understand the robotics industry nationally and internationally. 1.  The Department of Commerce should establish a federal advisory committee to advise the government on the needs of the robotics industry and how policy can build the U.S. robotics industry. Members should be predominantly from industry, with some from academia. 2.  The Department of Commerce International Trade Administration should expand its focus on robotics. This is a key emerging technology, and Commerce needs stronger analytical capabilities about the industry domestically and international challenges and opportunities. 3.  The U.S. Census Bureau should accelerate the timeline for releasing data from the Annual Integrated Economic Survey (AIES), which provides comprehensive data regarding national and subnational data on business activity, including data on robotics previously included as part of the Annual Survey of Manufactures and Annual Capital Expenditures Survey. The current timeline for releasing AIES data is nearly two years after collection, which makes it difficult to track changes in a rapidly evolving industry. [75] Scientific and Engineering Research Support 4.  Charge NSF with placing a higher priority on robotics research, especially research with significant industry relevance. NSF should establish one or more new Industry-University Research Partnership centers and engineering research centers for robotics.  OSTP should organize cross-agency efforts to advance AI use in edge networks, as the evolution of robotics depends on robust use of AI in robotics.  5.  NSF’s Technology Innovation and Partnerships (TIP) program should select robotics for its next major technology area for support. As ITIF has written, TIP was supposed to receive significant funding under the CHIPS and Science Act to support translational and industry-relevant research in 10 strategic technology areas. [76] Lack of appropriations, compounded by recent NSF budget cuts, has meant TIP has only funded two technology areas, at only modest amounts. Congress should provide increased funding for a new TIP research initiative focused on robotics. However, no funding should be forthcoming if NSF reinstates the limitations it placed on in its prior National Robotics Initiative, which supported research only on robotics technology that complements rather than replaces workers. By limiting research funding in this way, NSF slowed the development of robotics technologies that can significantly boost productivity. In addition, it is worth noting that NSF’s National Robotics Initiative provides funding of between only $30 million and $50 million per year, a pittance when compared with what PRC governments are spending. [77] 6.  The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should establish a cross-cutting robotics research working group to coordinate and align all agency mission-oriented research related to robotics. This could be similar to the National Nanotechnology Initiative established in the 1990s. This is important because a variety of different agencies support research into various components of the robotics research system. And where agencies are underinvesting in robotics, such as the Department of Agriculture, they should be instructed to invest a greater share of their portfolios in robotics. 7.  OSTP should organize cross-agency efforts to advance AI use in edge networks, as the evolution of robotics depends on robust use of AI in robotics. Industry Support 8.  The Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration should continue to support the regional innovation hub program, especially the one in Southwestern Pennsylvania focused on robotics. [78] As Commerce does this, and as the Office of Management and Budget is considering funding requests, both should keep in mind that China’s robotics hub is likely funded 20 to 40 times more generously. In addition, if possible, TIP should fund at least one regional innovation “engine” focused on robotics. 9.  Congress should increase funding for NIST’s Manufacturing USA program, including expanded funding for the Advanced Robotics Manufacturing (ARM) center. ARM has completed over 120 advanced technology projects—including new tooling, sensors, and software—related to robotics. 10. NIST should work with industry to coordinate data collection and sharing to support AI and robotics. Unlike large language models, which train on a large corpus of publicly available Internet data or licensed digital media, AI use in robotics is constrained by a lack of data. There is limited data to teach robots how to move, grasp and manipulate objects, understand directions, and recognize activity in different environments, such as households, factories, and sidewalks. Computer scientist Hans Peter Brondmo has argued that it will take deploying “many thousands, maybe even millions of robots doing stuff in the real world” to collect enough data to train them to do more than generally well-defined, narrow tasks. [79] NIST should work with the robotics industry (including firms that use robotics) to identify barriers to greater data collection and sharing as well as solutions to these challenges.  Congress should increase funding for NIST’s Manufacturing USA program, including expanded funding for the ARM center.  Adoption 11. Charge NIST’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) with creating a new robotics initiative that helps all centers better support SME manufacturers with adopting robots. As noted, few SME manufacturers use robotics. This is because the return on investment (ROI) does not meet hurdle rates, and also due to risk aversion and lack of both knowledge of robotics capabilities and expertise in implementation. Some state MEPs are exploring innovative ways to educate small manufacturers about the benefits of robotics. For instance, South Dakota MEP’s Automation Lab in Sioux Falls mitigates risk in acquiring new technologies by housing on-site cobots and providing a beta test environment for specific applications. South Dakota’s MEP operates a state-wide roadshow going into the field to demonstrate how rural manufacturers could effectively deploy cobots. The MEP program should develop a coherent strategy across states to educate U.S. small manufacturers on the benefits of robotics deployment and adoption. 12. Appropriate a modest amount of funds to NIST for a robotics best practices adoption award. Under this, SME companies could apply to use robotics in innovative ways, with NIST providing half the funding. As a condition of winning the award, a company would be required to share its learning with any other U.S. companies or organizations interested in learning about how the technology works and can be used. This is important because a major barrier for firms adopting robots is uncertainty about whether and for whom such an investment would pay off. Funding could be as little as $10 million per year. 13.  The National Economic Council (NEC) should task each major agency with identifying application areas where robotics can assist in the completion of their missions. There is precedent for this. In the last decade, the Department of Interior was quite forward on the use of drones to accomplish its mission of managing federal lands. That kind of approach should be used by all relevant agencies. For example, the Department of Interior could examine the role of robotics in forest and land management. The Department of Transportation could examine the role of robotics in road construction and maintenance. The Department of Health and Human Services could examine the role of robots in hospitals and other health care settings. The Department of Justice could support the deployment of policing robots. [80] Agencies such as the United States Postal Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation could utilize robotics in their missions, including warehouse operations. The Department of Homeland Security is an example of an agency that has received significant funds in the Big Beautiful Bill for deployment of technology to secure the borders, including from illegal drug traffic. Robotics could potentially play a role in drug interdiction at the border. Because of its size and large procurement budget, the Department of Defense will likely play the largest role in purchasing robotics for the non-warfighter part of its mission. Unfortunately, there is no robotics coordinating function for all of the department. Purchasing and planning decisions are made in the services and at the decentralized levels within the services. While this should not change, Defense should have a dedicated assessment and coordinating role for departmental robotics use.

North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho have a shared interest in serving the needs of rural and tribal communities, and more broadly the nation, by developing and fielding autonomous systems in critical sectors including transportation, agriculture, mining, energy, defense, and health care.  Autonomous systems provide significant benefits, including increased safety, efficiency, resiliency, and inter-operability, while also addressing challenges such as workforce shortages and economic disparities in rural and tribal areas.  This region is poised to build and deepen an autonomy-based innovation ecosystem given the strong needs/demands, its deep expertise in use-inspired needs, its existing capabilities across its critical sectors (transportation, agriculture, etc.), and its strong partnerships with stakeholders who require or engage with autonomous systems, with government agencies that establish policy and regulations, with industry, academia, and government organizations, and with economic development organizations that enable realization/commercialization.  The project''s academic partners are the University of North Dakota, Montana State University, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, and Boise State University, which will partner with the Tribal Nations Research Group in Belcourt, ND.  These partners, combined with stakeholders (communities, industry sectors, etc.), government agencies that establish policy and regulations, and suppliers of AS solutions (industry, tribal leadership, academia, government, economic development organizations), comprise the NFASIDE leadership team, ensuring that all aspects that are critical to the realization of the benefits of autonomous systems are incorporated.

This project will identify needs/use cases, develop, and translate autonomous systems into practice.  Key enablers include clear delineation of needs/opportunities, consolidation of a team that has both deep and broad expertise in key areas, early engagement with stakeholders to ensure realization viability within desired timeframes, extensive utilization of digital engineering to accelerate development, close coupling of development stages, clear pathways to translation/commercialization, and workforce development that serves all stakeholders - especially under-represented populations across the educational spectrum from high schools to post-doctoral programs.  This effort will coalesce the NFASIDE team to provide an organizational and operational structure and a roadmap for realizing a self-sustaining and productive AS engine that drives the rapid realization of autonomous systems'' benefits.

They integrate multimodal perception, world modeling, and adaptive control to support closed-loop interaction in dynamic and uncertain environments. Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) are profoundly transforming this field, providing the tools to achieve its long-envisioned capabilities of semantic understanding and robust generalization. Targeting the central challenge of how modern MLMs and WMs jointly advance embodied intelligence, this review provides a comprehensive overview across key dimensions, including multimodal perception, cross-modal alignment, adaptive decision-making, and Sim-to-Real transfer. Furthermore, we systematize these components into a three-stage theoretical framework termed “Dynamic Perception–Task Adaptation (DP-TA)”. This framework integrates multimodal perception modeling, causally driven world state prediction, and semantically guided strategy optimization, establishing a comprehensive “perception–modeling–decision” loop. To support this, we introduce a “Feature-Conditioned Modal Alignment (F-CMA)” mechanism to enhance cross-modal fusion under task constraints. 1 Introduction The early paradigm of artificial intelligence was largely grounded in the concept of “Disembodied intelligence”. The central goal of this approach was to mimic human intelligent behavior by focusing on enabling machines to simulate human-like thought processes. However, this was done without considering a physical body or an environmental context. These systems’ reasoning relied on static data and pre-defined rules. Because they lacked direct perception and interaction with the physical world, they faced significant limitations, often showing poor generalization, weak adaptability to new tasks, and inefficient interactions in real-world scenarios ( Nathan, 2023 ). Furthermore, real-world environments are increasingly characterized by uncertainty, sensory complexity, and task diversity, making the limitations of traditional disembodied AI increasingly clear. This has created a pressing need to develop intelligent systems that can interact effectively with their environment and adapt their structure accordingly. In sharp contrast, the embodied intelligence paradigm emphasizes that intelligence arises through continuous closed-loop interaction between an agent and its environment. Such agents are defined by their physical bodies, sensors, and effectors, which together ground perception and action. The idea is not entirely new; its philosophical and engineering roots can be traced back to the cybernetics movement. Subsequent advances in behavioral robotics ( Brooks, 1999 ; Arkin, 1998 ) and cognitive architecture theories ( Laird et al., 1987 ) laid the foundations for the principles of embodiment and the perception–decision–execution loop. Building on these ideas, researchers demonstrated how autonomous agents could exhibit robust and adaptive behaviors in complex environments ( Pfeifer and Scheier, 2001 ). This trajectory was further advanced by pioneering work in Evolutionary Robotics ( Cliff et al., 1993 ), which explored automatic controller design, and by cognitive architectures like CLARION ( Sun, 2007 ) and the Multilevel Darwinist Brain (MDB) ( Bellas et al., 2010 ), which integrated learning, reasoning, and embodiment long before the current era of large models. The historical trajectory of embodied intelligence is shown in Figure 1 . FIGURE 1 Development timeline of embodied intelligence. For many years, applying these principles in practice has been challenging due to limitations in perception, computation, and reasoning. Recently, however, advances in multimodal large models (MLMs) and world models (WMs) have opened new possibilities. These developments provide researchers with powerful tools to tackle longstanding challenges, bringing us closer to building the embodied agents envisioned in earlier research. Driven by these technologies, the field is undergoing a profound transformation from early modular integration architectures to unified modeling frameworks ( Roy et al., 2021 ). MLMs, including RT-2 ( Zitkovich et al., 2023 ) and OpenVLA ( Kim et al., 2024 ), are built on cross-modal Transformer architectures. This design enables them to create a unified representation from different input types, such as vision and language, and perform joint reasoning to achieve end-to-end control that directly translates natural language commands into physical actions. Concurrently, WMs ( Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018b ) aim to build an internal understanding of an environment by learning its latent states, enabling them to simulate potential future states and model causal relationships. This capability provides agents with a deeper understanding and facilitates effective knowledge transfer across different tasks ( Deitke et al., 2020 ). The combination of MLMs and WMs brings notable benefits, including improved system generality, support for cross-task learning, and facilitated deployment from simulation to reality (Sim-to-Real). This paper reviews how these modern advancements are revolutionizing the implementation of embodied systems. Our analysis centers on the synergistic integration of MLMs and WMs as a central focus for advancing embodied intelligence. The discussion is organized around key dimensions such as multimodal perception, cross-modal alignment, and Sim-to-Real transfer. Despite these advances, important gaps remain. Specifically, there is no complete framework that integrates all components systematically. As a result, issues such as information coupling, module decoupling, and interface design are still unresolved ( Liu et al., 2025 ). To address these challenges, this review proposes a structured modeling framework for embodied intelligent systems: the DP-TA (Dynamic Perception–Task Adaptation) three-layer fusion architecture. This framework decomposes embodied systems into three core functional layers: multimodal perception and alignment, world modeling and task graph generation, and policy adaptation and execution scheduling. These layers correspond to the key processing stages from perceptual input to action output, as illustrated in Figure 2 . FIGURE 2 Dynamic perception–task adaptation framework. To support this architecture, we introduce the Feature-Conditioned Modal Alignment (F-CMA) mechanism, which models how task semantics guide perceptual fusion strategies, thereby enhancing the system’s goal consistency and adaptability. The DP-TA framework not only provides a unified interface specification for multimodal perception, large-scale cognitive modeling, and policy execution but also offers a structured methodological framework for constructing embodied systems with high task generalization and flexible deployment capabilities. The core contributions of this study are summarized as follows: 1. We systematize the structural fusion of embodied intelligent systems into a framework termed DP-TA, which clearly delineates the functional boundaries of the three core layers—perception, modeling, and policy control—and their collaborative coupling paths. 2. We introduce the F-CMA mechanism, enriching the methodology for cross-modal information alignment. 3. From a system-functional perspective, we synthesize representative mechanisms and synergistic structures that integrate multimodal large models and world models, analyzing their roles in behavior generation and task planning. 4. We examine core mechanisms and optimization pathways for the policy layer, encompassing advanced approaches such as Prompt-Policy structures, tokenized state representations, and skill graph scheduling. We also systematically identify key system-level optimization strategies for task deployment and module sharing. 5. We identify core challenges in current research and outline future trends, focusing on semantic consistency modeling, multi-policy architecture fusion, lightweight world model construction, and multi-task adaptation. 2 Multimodal perception and dynamic alignment 2.1 Research background and system value of multimodal perception The perception module has long been recognized as the critical starting point for environmental information flow in intelligent systems, with its performance fundamentally determining the quality of subsequent modeling and decision-making processes. While early embodied systems relied on traditional sensor fusion techniques ( Durrant-Whyte and Henderson, 2016 ) and state estimation methods ( Thrun, 2002 ) for integrating limited modal data, the field has evolved significantly. In contrast to these traditional single-modal or basic multimodal perception paradigms, modern embodied environments require the sophisticated collaborative integration of heterogeneous modal data, including visual, linguistic, haptic, and depth information ( Ma et al., 2024 ). This requirement elevates the core challenges of multimodal perception to cross-modal semantic fusion, modeling complementary information, dynamic temporal alignment, and robustness under environmental disturbances and sensor uncertainties. With breakthroughs in the theory of joint representation of language, vision, and action ( Ma et al., 2024 ), multimodal perception has emerged as a key enabling technology to achieve closed-loop collaboration between language instruction parsing, environmental state feedback, and adaptive task planning. Representative works such as LXMERT ( Tan and Bansal, 2019 ) and MDETR ( Kamath et al., 2021 ) establish semantic associations between modalities through cross-modal attention mechanisms, thus laying the theoretical foundation for perception-cognition coupling in embodied tasks. Beyond this, very recent work continues to push the boundaries of multimodal integration. The OmniSegmentor framework ( Yin et al., 2025 ) demonstrates a universal pre-training paradigm across five visual modalities (RGB, depth, thermal, etc.), significantly boosting perceptual capabilities and setting new state-of-the-art records on multiple segmentation benchmarks. This highlights a trend towards more flexible and powerful general-purpose multi-modal perception backbones for embodied agents. The universal applicability in scenarios such as robotics, human-computer interaction, and semantic navigation further highlights the systemic value of this paradigm. 2.2 Modeling perceptual uncertainty and cross-modal alignment Multimodal perception has increasingly become the core input component of Embodied Intelligent systems. However, modeling perceptual uncertainty and achieving cross-modal semantic alignment remain critical challenges. The theoretical challenge lies in establishing a paradigm for uncertainty modeling. Based on the sources of uncertainty, two fundamentally distinct theoretical categories can be identified. The first category stems from the inherent ambiguity, incompleteness, and environmental interference present in perceptual data itself, such as motion blur, sensor noise, and local occlusion. This type of uncertainty is referred to as intrinsic uncertainty, which possesses an irreparable nature. Its likelihood distribution must be modeled through mechanisms such as probabilistic heatmap prediction, multi-hypothesis output branches, and confidence regression ( Kendall and Gal, 2017 ). The other category stems from insufficient prior knowledge in the model, typically manifested as a covariate shift between the training data distribution and the real-world scenario. This is referred to as cognitive uncertainty, and its modeling relies on theoretical frameworks such as Bayesian neural networks, Dropout random sampling ( Gal and Ghahramani, 2016 ), and ensemble learning ( Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017 ) to enhance the model’s robustness in unknown scenarios. In embodied tasks, these two types of uncertainty often overlap and are further influenced by the heterogeneity among multimodal inputs. For instance, semantic ambiguity between vision and language modalities, as well as modality loss caused by sensor failures, can significantly interfere with policy learning and decision-making. To address this challenge, previous studies have proposed a series of cross-modal alignment mechanisms (see, e.g., ( Hossain et al., 2025 ), Fed-CMA ( Chen et al., 2020 )) to mitigate the propagation of inconsistencies to downstream tasks. While these alignment methods cover a wide range of strategies, from explicit mappings (e.g., image-text labels) to implicit attention mechanisms (e.g., cross-modal Transformer fusion), they lack the ability to dynamically perceive task objectives. Consequently, when task semantics change or input modalities shift, such methods often struggle to achieve reliable alignment and adaptive fusion. For example, in language-guided grasping tasks, systems frequently cannot make robust fusion decisions when confronted with ambiguous language goals (e.g., “grab the edge”) or occluded image modalities. To mitigate these limitations, particularly the lack of semantic regulation and structural preservation during cross-modal alignment, recent work has incorporated the concept of feature-conditioned guidance into local mechanisms. For example, FiLM ( Perez et al., 2022 ) modulates the normalization parameters of the visual branch using language features, enabling conditionally aware visual encoding; MDETR ( Kamath et al., 2021 ) uses text fragments as queries to explicitly guide the detection and alignment of objects in images, establishing semantic correspondences between phrases and image regions; BLIP-2 ( Li et al., 2023 ) introduces a phased freezing and multimodal alignment modulation mechanism in its training policy, achieving cross-modal semantic modeling while maintaining the stability of the unimodal encoder structure; VIMA ( Jiang et al., 2022 ) uses language prompts as conditional inputs for policy generation, achieving a conditional bridge from perception to action. Very recently, research in 2024 has further advanced this paradigm by developing more generalizable and robust conditionally-aligned models. For instance, ( Belkhale et al., 2024 ), introduced RT-H (Robotic Transformer with Hierarchical Planning), which leverages a language-conditioned transformer architecture to generate precise motor control commands from complex natural language instructions and visual inputs, demonstrating superior real-world performance. These latest efforts highlight a clear shift towards building large-scale, task-aware, and semantically grounded conditional alignment systems that are both scalable and adaptable. Although these methods have different application objectives, they fundamentally embody the prototype mechanism of “using explicit features from one modality as conditions to guide the representation process of another modality.” Therefore, this study unifies such mechanisms under the name “Feature-Conditional Modality Alignment (F-CMA),” as illustrated in Figure 3 . This paradigm is well-suited to the need for deep collaborative modeling of heterogeneous modalities in embodied intelligence, enabling task-semantics-driven multimodal fusion and uncertainty modeling. FIGURE 3 Diagram of the proposed Feature-Conditioned Modality Alignment (F-CMA) framework. Task prompts modulate vision and language features through a dynamic conditioning mechanism, followed by structure-aware fusion to ensure geometric and semantic consistency. A feedback path maintains structural alignment under uncertainty. 3 Policy generation and task adaptation The problem of how an agent maps world states to actions—the policy—has deep roots in control theory and early AI. Classical approaches ranged from deliberative planners ( Fikes and Nilsson, 1971 ) that operate on symbolic representations to reactive, behavior-based systems ( Brooks, 2003 ) that emphasize a tight coupling between sensors and actuators. These establish the fundamental trade-offs between planning and reactivity. In contemporary Embodied AI, the policy module continues to play a pivotal role, but its challenges have expanded. Operating in dynamic environments, it must not only comprehend the current state but also generate behavioral decisions characterized by generalization capability, stability, and efficiency, all under the guidance of complex semantic task objectives. 3.1 Cognitive positioning of the policy module The traditional definition of policy is limited to state-action mapping modeling. For embodied intelligence, this definition is clearly overly simplistic. Embodied systems must operate in open environments, utilizing multi-source sensory inputs, dynamic uncertainties, and diverse constraints arising from complex task objectives. Consequently, the policy module should be conceptualized not as an “end-effector controller” but as a Structural Task Adapter (STA). The role of the policy module in Embodied Intelligence should be reinterpreted as a multi-task decision path generator based on perceptual states and semantic goals, possessing task restructuring, resource scheduling, and semantic alignment capabilities. The design of the policy module should not be limited to mapping modeling but should include the following three cognitive functions. First, the policy should internalize the ability to model semantic task conditions. It should not merely “see the state and perform actions” but should deeply understand “what my current goal is” and seamlessly integrate task conditions in the form of text instructions or semantic graphs into the policy generation process. For example, text instructions are converted into embeddings and directly drive a multimodal Transformer for control prediction in the RT-H ( Belkhale et al., 2024 ) system; and Prompt-DT ( Xu et al., 2022 ) encodes instructions and environmental trajectories together into generated plan tokens, which are typical examples of this capability. Second, the policy must have the core functionality of structured path generation. Modern embodied policies no longer output a single action but instead output structured trajectories that include causal dependencies between sub-goals. For example, DreamerV3 ( Hafner et al., 2025 ) performs “inner loop prediction” in the world model to generate plans; SayCan ( Ahn et al., 2022 ) uses an LLM to output multi-step sub-tasks, which are then executed by the actuator. Therefore, the policy network should have temporal awareness, semantic consistency, and planning capabilities ( Kaelbling and Lozano-Pérez, 2011 ). Finally, the policy must achieve task scheduling and system interface decoupling, with the policy module automatically selecting sub-policies, functional modules, or control parameters based on task conditions. Successful implementations in multi-task systems like Gato ( Reed et al., 2022 ) and ChatVLA ( Zhou et al., 2025 ) demonstrate that policies are no longer “functions” but flexible “scheduling entry points.” Within the DP-TA theoretical framework, the policy generation and adaptation layer occupies the top-level decision-making module of the system. Its inputs integrate multi-modal environmental states provided by the perception and alignment layer ( Parisi et al., 2022 ), future states predicted by the world modeling layer and causal inference chains ( Kaelbling and Lozano-Pérez, 2011 ), as well as semantic goal streams defined by user tasks ( Ahn et al., 2022 ) or LLM ( Xie et al., 2023 ) modules. The outputs of the policy layer must satisfy three key requirements: 1) direct executability by controllers or downstream modules ( Liang et al., 2022 ); 2) effective responsiveness to task variations and resource constraints ( Ge et al., 2023 ); 3) interpretability through visualization and analysis in the form of tokens, trajectories, or graph formats. The hierarchical structure of DP-TA relieves the policy module of the entire inference burden, freeing it to focus on integrating contextual structure and semantic goals; thereby, it functions as an efficient task scheduler ( Liang et al., 2022 ), representing a fundamental departure from traditional pipeline-based control systems. In summary, the cognitive positioning of embodied policy modules is evolving from “action selectors” to “structural task schedulers” to support multimodal semantic fusion, task decomposition, and dynamic module invocation ( Liang et al., 2022 ; Brohan et al., 2022 ). 3.2 The evolutionary path of policy mechanisms and prompts The policy generation mechanism in embodied intelligence has evolved progressively from action-supervised learning to structured decision generation. This evolution signifies a paradigm shift from “input-dimension constraints” to “structure-modeling enhancement” ( Levine et al., 2020 ), underscoring the transformation of policy modules from purely executive functions toward cognitive systems. Contemporary mainstream approaches to policy generation can be broadly classified into three systematic paradigms: mapping-based, optimization-based, and structure-based. The mapping paradigm represents the most direct supervised learning path for early perception-action systems, with Behavior Cloning (BC) ( Torabi et al., 2018 ) and Imitation Learning (IL) ( Zheng et al., 2024 ) serving as its representative methods. Its core assumption is that, given a state, supervised learning can approximate the expert policy, thereby achieving an end-to-end mapping from perception to action. Methods within this paradigm, exemplified by systems such as RT-1 ( Brohan et al., 2022 ) and BC-Z ( Jang et al., 2022 ), demonstrate effective cold-start performance, particularly in fixed-process, single-task operational workflows. However, this modeling approach treats task objectives as implicit conditions, resulting in a policy that lacks adaptability to instruction variations or environmental dynamics ( Shafiullah et al., 2022 ). Consequently, when task objectives change, the policy cannot structurally adapt, leading to performance degradation in multi-task or temporally extended planning scenarios. Although characterized by high training efficiency, the inherent lack of structured representation within the policy hinders support for intra-task causal reasoning or cross-semantic transfer. The optimization paradigm is based on reinforcement learning, which uses reward-driven behavioral strategy learning as its theoretical foundation. Starting from the task objective, the policy is iteratively optimized through reward signals ( Josic, 2021 ). Modeling typically combines a policy function with a state-value function or Q-function. In embodied tasks, systems like DreamerV3 ( Hafner et al., 2025 ) leverage world models for “virtual interaction,” significantly enhancing learning efficiency and environmental generalization capabilities ( Schrittwieser et al., 2020 ). This approach incorporates long-term reward modeling and emergent policy self-organization, making it theoretically more suitable for complex goal-oriented planning. Nevertheless, it faces practical challenges including training instability and high sample complexity ( Dulac-Arnold et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, the tight coupling between the policy and its training environment compromises module transferability and policy reusability. Recent research is advancing strategic modeling towards a structural planning paradigm. Here, language prompts, planning structures, and causal graphs serve as the primary entry points for strategy control. Prompts have evolved beyond mere instructions to function as task-driven mechanisms for strategy configuration ( Shin et al., 2020 ). At the foundational level, task conditioning provides the core task semantics (“what to do”), exemplified by directives such as “place the red cup on the left shelf”. At a deeper level, behavioral guidance navigates complex strategy spaces by offering “how to do it” directions. This effectively creates a “semantic roadmap” that identifies the optimal behavioral choice within multi-strategy contexts ( Belkhale et al., 2024 ). The highest level structural interface transforms natural language or semantic prompts into tokens, graphs, or intermediate representations. This facilitates the strategy module’s uniform processing of interface information spanning language, perception, and control. This methodology departs from conventional approaches that directly learn state-to-action mappings. Instead, it frames strategy modeling as a structured generation task: sub-goal sequences, planning tokens, or semantic graphs are first constructed and subsequently decoded into specific control instructions. Integrating Prompts Deeply into Control Pipelines. The SayCan system exemplifies the “language prompt sub-goal decomposition” approach. In this paradigm ( Ahn et al., 2022 ), user instructions are initially processed by a large language model (LLM) to generate a structured sequence of sub-tasks (e.g., pick move place). Subsequently, an actuator selects executable modules based on the current perceptual state, while a dedicated strategy controller handles only the final execution step. This approach significantly enhances strategy interpretability and composability. However, its effectiveness is critically dependent on the planning quality of the external LLM, and it lacks a real-time feedback loop during execution. Conversely, the Prompt-DT paradigm employs a “prompt token action sequence generation” strategy. Here, natural language prompts are concatenated with state trajectories and fed into a Transformer decoder to predict sequences of future behavior tokens ( Xu et al., 2022 ). This method effectively integrates the efficiency of imitation learning with the flexibility of prompts, demonstrating robust multi-task adaptability and stable performance under low-data regimes. Its key innovation lies in decoupling task abstraction from the training architecture, thereby supporting instruction-level nesting and generalization. Representing the most promising end-to-end solution, the RT-2 ( Zitkovich et al., 2023 ) system embodies the “unified token representation multimodal policy control” paradigm. It encodes heterogeneous inputs (e.g., images, language instructions) into a unified token sequence, which is then processed by a multi-layer Transformer for direct strategy prediction and control output. This architecture not only unifies the input processing pipeline but also establishes a genuine end-to-end closed loop bridging perception and control. Such advancements are poised to endow strategy modules with “elastic structures” and “adaptive computation paths,” ultimately realizing a unified decision-making loop that translates natural language instructions into structured, interpretable, and high-performance behavioral responses. 3.3 System adaptation of the policy module Embodied Intelligent systems are increasingly deployed not in closed experimental settings, but in open, dynamic, and resource-limited real-world environments. Consequently, the evaluation metrics for strategy modules extend beyond mere “task completion rate” or “reward function maximization” to encompass. A comprehensive set of factors includes system load capacity (latency, power consumption); multi-task versatility (prompt support, semantic compatibility); training-to-deployment transferability (Sim-to-Real stability ( Liu et al., 2024 ), module consistency); and structural compression capability (decoder depth, module reusability). This paradigm shift necessitates the evolution of the strategy module beyond its traditional “strategy modeling” function into a “System Adapter.” This adapter forms a mediating layer between the strategy structure and deployment logic, implementing four key adaptation pathways (as illustrated in Figure 4 ). Figure 4 summarizes the four primary adaptation mechanisms employed in the strategy module design of current mainstream embodied systems, spanning critical areas such as simulation transfer, lightweight deployment ( Xiao et al., 2023 ), task offloading, and control precision scheduling. FIGURE 4 Four key pathways for policy adaptation in embodied systems: Sim-to-Real transfer, lightweight deployment, multi-policy sharing, and task-aware precision scheduling. First, the simulation-reality gap remains a core challenge in deploying embodied control systems. Relying solely on the policy itself is insufficient to address domain shifts, necessitating auxiliary mechanisms to ensure consistency in state representations. For instance, DreamerV3 ( Hafner et al., 2025 ) enhances policy stability significantly by combining world model-based recurrent rollouts with dynamic reward reconstruction. Similarly, Prompt-DT ( Xu et al., 2022 ) leverages language prompts to guide trajectory generation, maintaining alignment between instructions and behaviors across diverse task objectives, thereby demonstrating strong real-world transferability. Ultimately, Sim-to-Real is not a perception issue but fundamentally a challenge of structural consistency, requiring the establishment of a structural identity mapping between policy inputs, state representations, and trajectory generation logic. Second, lightweight policy deployment is critical, particularly in edge devices or multi-task systems where model size and inference latency become key bottlenecks. Current mainstream approaches include utilizing the Prompt Pool mechanism to compress multiple instructions into a shared token space; replacing the policy decoder with structures like TinyMPC or LightweightHead; and strategically reducing input resolution while enhancing instruction semantic quality to achieve a complementary “control precision-input intensity” trade-off. Beyond these algorithmic optimizations, groundbreaking work in full-system co-design has demonstrated the feasibility of deploying complex policies on affordable, mobile platforms. The Mobile ALOHA 2 system ( Aldaco et al., 2024 ) exemplifies this by integrating a compact bimanual hardware design with a tailored imitation learning pipeline, enabling low-cost mobile manipulators to execute sophisticated bimanual tasks with high precision and robustness. This approach highlights that effective lightweight deployment often requires joint innovation across policy algorithms, hardware design, and data infrastructure. Taking RT-2 as an example, its policy network leverages multimodal embedding and hierarchical token fusion to maintain inference latency below 150 ms at 92 accuracy ( Zitkovich et al., 2023 ), demonstrating practical deployability. Third, multi-policy shared architectures offer a cost-effective solution for embodied systems, which typically encounter evolving tasks rather than structural changes. Consequently, a single universal policy is far less efficient than a shared backbone structure coupled with a dynamic switching mechanism. In the ChatVLA framework ( Zhou et al., 2025 ), language prompts are employed to select sub-policy paths, while all tasks share the main representation module (visual semantic control). This mechanism achieves lightweight module invocation through structural distillation and adapter injection, maintaining <5 accuracy degradation across nine distinct tasks while reducing memory usage by over 60 . Fourth, task-aware precision adjustment is essential for embodied systems operating continuously or under power constraints, requiring policy modules to be resource-sensitive to task objectives. This can include reducing decoder depth, activating lightweight execution branches, or integrating external planners, for example, leveraging a world model to preprocess predictions. Within the DP-TA architecture, the policy layer can serve as a precision-aware routing module, enabling resource-efficient control while maintaining task effectiveness. 3.4 Unified interface and pathway design for policy modules in the DP-TA architecture Within traditional embodied system architectures, the policy module is typically treated as the “model tail” or a “control module.” Its inputs and outputs are often tightly coupled with the specific implementation of preceding network components, lacking inherent structural independence and a well-defined interface. To address this limitation, we advocate for a redefinition of the policy layer within the DP-TA framework as a structurally explicit, interface-unified, and semantically autonomous module. This module bridges perception-modeling outputs with downstream execution demands, adapting flexibly to varying task objectives. From a structural perspective, the DP-TA’s policy generation and adaptation layer receives two types of information: one from the perception and alignment layer’s modal fusion state and the other from the world modeling layer’s dynamic state prediction. These inputs, integrated with task-specific objectives such as language prompts, graph structures, and skill descriptions, constitute the complete input set for the policy module. Its outputs encompass three critical elements: continuous motion commands (e.g., 6D poses ( Wen et al., 2024 ) or trajectory point sequences ( Bui et al., 2020 )) directed to the robot controller; behavior routing directives (e.g., sub-policy IDs or skill invocation signals) governing mid-level skill orchestration; and structured plan graphs or trajectory confidence estimates provided to the explanation layer, furnishing verifiable decision evidence for human oversight. The core contribution of the DP-TA policy layer is not simply to identify “which policy performs best” but to define a unified structural interface that accommodates a diverse ensemble of policy mechanisms—including behavior cloning, reinforcement learning, and model predictive control. This design enables the integration of a policy library (policy ensemble) with a routing mechanism (policy router) ( Lou et al., 2023 ), facilitating the dynamic selection, reconfiguration, and composition of policies based on contextual needs. Rather than focusing solely on selecting the best-performing policy model, we argue that a more critical research direction is how to architect a controllable and configurable policy space—one that can generalize across tasks, adapt across platforms, and respond to heterogeneous input modalities. To concretize this abstraction, Figure 5 illustrates the modular composition, interface pathways, and functional decoupling within the DP-TA policy generation layer. FIGURE 5 Unified structure and interface pathways of the policy module in the DP-TA architecture. In summary, the role of the policy module in DP-TA extends far beyond single action generation. It provides structured interfaces, enables semantics-driven scheduling, and facilitates controllable policy generation for complex systems. This conceptual shift establishes a novel paradigm for future embodied intelligence research, redirecting focus from individual model performance towards the structural design of the policy space and the modeling of execution capabilities. This approach paves the way for achieving genuine cognitive unification and task generalization. 4 The structural function and system integration of world models in embodied intelligence 4.1 The evolutionary trajectory of model structure The concept of an internal world model—an internal representation that allows an agent to simulate and predict the consequences of its actions—is a foundational idea in cognitive science and AI. It was central to the “sense-model-plan-act” paradigm ( Nilsson, 1984 ) that dominated early robotics. While limited by computational power, these early models, often based on Bayesian filters ( Kalman, 1960 ) or graphical models, aimed to maintain a belief state about the world. Today, the term “World Model” (WM) has been revitalized by deep learning. Modern WMs, powered by vast data and neural networks, comprehend the dynamics of the real world at an unprecedented scale, encompassing its physical and spatial properties. Utilizing multimodal input data including text, images, videos, and motion, they generate predictive video sequences ( Ding et al., 2025 ). Through learning, these models acquire an understanding of the physical characteristics governing real-world environments, enabling them to represent and forecast dynamics such as motion, stress, and spatial relationships within sensory data. Within the progression of embodied intelligence, the architectural evolution of world models has advanced from initial RNN encoders ( Yu et al., 2022 ) through latent state space modeling to contemporary multimodal Transformers endowed with structural awareness and causal reasoning capabilities ( Zhang et al., 2023 ). This evolution is now accelerating with the rise of generative world models that learn controllable dynamics from internet videos. Notable examples include Genie ( Bruce et al., 2024 ), which generates actionable 2D worlds from image prompts, and its successors that explore 3D physical reasoning ( Shang et al., 2025 ). This trajectory reflects three key evolutionary trends: from perceptual representation to state latent variable abstraction; from single-step prediction to trajectory rolling simulation and reward estimation; and from continuous variable generation to structural token combination modeling. A further significant evolution involves the shift from 2D-centric to 3D-grounded representations and from discriminative to generative world modeling. The recently proposed 3D-VLA model ( Zhen et al., 2024 ) epitomizes this trend. It is built upon a 3D-based large language model (LLM) and introduces a generative world model that predicts future 3D scenarios (as point clouds and images) through embodied diffusion models. This approach moves beyond direct perception-action mapping by enabling the model to ‘imagine’ the consequences of actions in a 3D space prior to planning, thereby seamlessly integrating 3D perception, reasoning, and action generation. These trends signify that world models are no longer merely auxiliary tools for policy training but are increasingly becoming structural modules with independent cognitive functions within embodied intelligence systems. As illustrated in Figure 6 , contemporary world model designs are expanding from modeling mere state transitions to generating semantic structural graphs. This expansion provides enhanced interpretability and multi-task adaptability for policy generation. The underlying model structures now seek a new equilibrium between abstract representational unification and explicit structural interpretability. Modern research on world models is thus undergoing a conceptual transition—from optimizing for predictive fidelity to emphasizing structural coherence and causal planning capability. This evolution positions the world model not merely as a support module for behavior, but increasingly as a central inferential agent within embodied cognitive systems. In conclusion, the ultimate goal of world modeling is not simply to replicate the external world, but to construct a structural proxy—a model capable of generating semantic graph representations that can inform strategy synthesis, instruction interpretation, and system-level coordination. This redefinition elevates world models to the role of cognitive infrastructure, essential for achieving generalizable and interpretable embodied intelligence. FIGURE 6 It illustrates the development trajectory from world models to representative systems such as DreamerV3 ( Hafner et al., 2025 ), Gato ( Reed et al., 2022 ), and DeepMind Genie. Each stage in the diagram summarizes its technical features and key models in chronological order, reflecting the evolution of world models from predictive tools to the core of cognitive structures. 4.2 The three functions of world modeling Within embodied intelligent systems, the role of world models extends far beyond functioning as mere environment simulators or state predictors ( Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018b ). We argue that world models should be redefined as structural state inference engines within the system. Their crucial responsibilities extend beyond dynamic modeling to enabling the system to achieve a functional closed-loop encompassing structural perception, cognitive simulation, and task planning across three key dimensions. First, State Reconstruction addresses the spatio-temporal alignment issues of heterogeneous modalities such as vision, language, and haptics. Distinct from the instantaneous representations generated at the perceptual layer, world models focus on capturing the dynamical concepts inherent in historical state sequences. A representative example is the Recursive State Space Model (RSSM) ( Hafner et al., 2019b ) utilized in DreamerV3 ( Hafner et al., 2025 ). This mechanism encodes latent states to capture the structural evolution of the environment, thereby establishing a structured representational foundation for subsequent reasoning. Next, Behavior Simulation builds a virtual interaction space based on the representation, evaluating the long-term benefits of action sequences through rollout prediction (e.g., MPC optimization), significantly reducing the cost of real-world interaction. The frontier of this research is moving towards highly controllable and fine-grained simulations. The GEM model ( Hassan et al., 2025 ) exemplifies this direction: it is a generative world model that predicts future ego-vision frames with precise, independent control over object dynamics, ego-agent motion, and human poses by conditioning on sparse features, trajectories, and pose data. By generating paired RGB and depth outputs autoregressively, GEM enables a rich, spatially-aware simulation space for testing diverse ‘what-if’ scenarios, greatly enhancing the robustness and versatility of policy learning in complex, multi-agent environments. Finally, Causal Graph Induction (CGI) essentially establishes an explicit reasoning chain of “goal action outcome”. This form of structured causal reasoning not only facilitates explainable task decomposition but also endows the system with counterfactual reasoning capabilities—predicting the potential consequences of actions not taken, which is critical for safety-aware decision-making in high-risk scenarios. 4.3 Cognitive architecture for world modeling and strategy coordination In an ideal embodied intelligent system, the world model and the policy module should form a stable cognition–control feedback loop. Specifically, the world model handles structural state modeling and causal planning, while the policy module determines behavioral trajectories based on the world model’s outputs ( Rohekar et al., 2024 ). This interaction forms a closed-loop information flow integrating environmental perception, internal modeling, and execution control. Such coupling is reflected not only in the data flow but also in the functional alignment and structural co-design of the two modules. The following discusses three mainstream approaches to achieving this integration. The most basic form of coordination treats the world model as a state prior generator for the policy. For instance, Dreamer ( Hafner et al., 2019a ) leverages a learned environmental dynamics model to generate synthetic trajectory rollouts. Concurrently, an internal reward model optimizes policy parameters. In this setup, the task of policy training is effectively delegated to the simulated environment, decoupling learning from physical interactions and significantly improving cross-environment generalization. A more structured approach organizes the world model and policy module into a hierarchical decision-making pipeline. Here, the world model functions as a structural planner, decomposing high-level goals into structured sequences of sub-tasks (e.g., “clean spilled liquid on the table fetch cloth wipe surface”), while the policy module selects low-level control strategies under given constraints to execute each step. This architecture offers a clear separation between planning and execution, well-defined module boundaries, and strong interpretability. However, it places stringent demands on logical consistency—inconsistent sub-goals (e.g., “move an unsecured object”) may lead to irrecoverable execution failures. The most advanced trend adopts a unified token-based architecture, embedding both the world model and policy module within a single Transformer framework to enable token-level inference–execution coupling. In this design, state observations, language instructions, and behavioral tokens are embedded in a single input sequence. Causal attention mechanisms are then employed to model cross-modal temporal dependencies ( Chen et al., 2021 ). The policy decoder subsequently outputs either the next action or module invocation within the same token s', 'Embodied intelligent systems build upon the foundations of behavioral robotics and classical cognitive architectures.', NULL, 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1668910/full', '{"market": {"game": "embodied intelligence systems", "state": null, "jackpot": null, "revenue": null, "mom_change": null, "yoy_change": null, "draw_number": null, "report_date": null, "key_findings": ["Embodied intelligent systems integrate multimodal perception, world modeling, and structured strategies.", "They are built on behavioral robotics and classical cognitive architectures.", "The framework consists of three layers: perception, modeling, and strategy.", "Applications include humanoid robotics, industrial automation, and human-robot interaction.", "Research topics cover a wide range of robotics fields, including bio-inspired and soft robotics."], "sales_volume": null, "ticket_price": null, "domain_payload": {"asp": null, "domain": "embodied_ai", "region": null, "segment": "embodied intelligence systems", "highlights": ["Embodied intelligent systems integrate multimodal perception, world modeling, and structured strategies.", "They are built on behavioral robotics and classical cognitive architectures.", "The framework consists of three layers: perception, modeling, and strategy.", "Applications include humanoid robotics, industrial automation, and human-robot interaction.", "Research topics cover a wide range of robotics fields, including bio-inspired and soft robotics."], "mom_growth": null, "yoy_growth": null, "market_size": null, "report_date": null, "model_or_version": null, "deployment_volume": null, "financing_or_order_amount": null}}, "entities": [{"span": null, "text": "embodied intelligent systems", "type": "system"}, {"span": null, "text": "behavioral robotics", "type": "field"}, {"span": null, "text": "cognitive architectures", "type": "field"}, {"span": null, "text": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "type": "organization"}, {"span": null, "text": "multimodal perception", "type": "concept"}], "entities_relations": {"entities": [{"span": null, "text": "embodied intelligent systems", "type": "system"}, {"span": null, "text": "behavioral robotics", "type": "field"}, {"span": null, "text": "cognitive architectures", "type": "field"}, {"span": null, "text": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "type": "organization"}, {"span": null, "text": "multimodal perception", "type": "concept"}], "relations": [{"date": null, "object": "embodied intelligent systems", "subject": "Frontiers in Robotics and AI", "evidence": "", "predicate": "reports_on", "confidence": 0.5}, {"date": null, "object": "behavioral robotics", "subject": "embodied intelligent systems", "evidence": "", "predicate": "develops", "confidence": 0.5}, {"date": null, "object": "cognitive architectures", "subject": "embodied intelligent systems", "evidence": "", "predicate": "integrates", "confidence": 0.5}]}}', '2026-02-26 14:34:23.490839+00', '2026-02-26 17:57:34.979075+00', 138);

NEW YORK, July 17, 2025 (Newswire.com)
        - Explore the Full Manifested AI Forecast at BrownstoneResearch.com (Discover how Tesla''s next announcement could reshape the robotics economy.) TL;DR Summary Brownstone Research has published a new industry outlook on "Manifested AI" - the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics - with a special focus on Tesla''s expected humanoid robotics announcement on July 23, 2025. This release explores how emerging AI-embodied machines could catalyze a $25 trillion global market shift, impact every industrial sector, and permanently alter how businesses and households interact with technology. In This Report, You''ll Discover: What "Manifested AI" really means and how it differs from standard AI Why Brownstone Research believes Tesla''s July 2025 announcement could become a historic technology turning point What industries are most likely to benefit from humanoid robotics Which supply chain categories could see exponential demand growth How companies like Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and Figure AI are shaping the robotics landscape What long-term effects this revolution could have on global markets, labor, and policy What Is Manifested AI? A New Chapter in Intelligent Machines Manifested AI is a term used to describe the physical embodiment of artificial intelligence in real-world hardware. Where most people associate AI with chatbots, cloud models, or predictive algorithms, manifested AI exists in a tangible form - such as a robot that can see, move, and respond to its environment like a human. These systems are built with a convergence of core technologies: Neural networks for real-time decision-making Advanced computer vision and spatial awareness Adaptive sensors and physical actuators Mechanical engineering that mimics biological movement Machine learning models trained on multimodal input In essence, manifested AI bridges the gap between cognition and physical function. These machines don''t just compute - they move, interact, and learn within the physical world. Why It Matters in 2025 The field of robotics is not new, but the AI-infused version of robotics entering 2025 is unlike anything the world has seen. This new generation of machines is: Context-aware (they can understand the environment and adjust) Flexible in function (programmed through software, not just code rewrites) Scalable (thanks to AI-driven mass learning rather than single-task tuning) The result? Machines that are no longer just tools - they''re adaptive systems capable of performing human-level tasks across countless sectors. Why Brownstone Research Is Watching This Trend Closely Brownstone Research is known for identifying emerging tech inflection points before they enter the mainstream. Their analysts have covered everything from early-stage biotech to autonomous vehicles and 5G infrastructure. But few technological waves have triggered as much internal focus as the rise of manifested AI. According to their July 2025 analysis: "We are entering a decade where intelligent machines will no longer be theoretical. They''ll be on factory floors, in hospitals, and in homes - not as software helpers, but as physical co-workers. Tesla''s upcoming announcement may prove to be a trigger moment that accelerates global awareness and adoption." - Brownstone Research Editorial Team In past research cycles, Brownstone has examined early AI, EV supply chains, and the rise of semiconductors. This time, their attention is on the intersection of AI, robotics, and real-world integration, with Tesla as the key catalyst. Why Tesla''s Role Is Different Tesla is not the first company to attempt humanoid robotics - nor the only one. But what makes Tesla a unique player in this ecosystem is its integrated control over every core technology layer. Key Advantages Tesla Brings to Manifested AI: AI Training Infrastructure: Tesla''s Dojo supercomputer trains neural networks using massive real-world driving data - a process directly transferable to robotics Custom Silicon Chips: The company develops its own AI inference chips optimized for real-time environments Energy Systems: Years of battery and thermal management give Tesla a head start in powering mobile robots Manufacturing Scale: Tesla knows how to go from prototype to mass production - a critical barrier in humanoid robotics Software Update Pipeline: Tesla can push over-the-air updates - an essential need for adaptive machines This suite of infrastructure allows Tesla to deploy and improve robotics hardware at scale - not in theory, but in practice. According to Brownstone Research, that''s why July 23, 2025, has become a milestone to watch. What to Expect on July 23, 2025 Tesla has not confirmed all details, but insiders and technology analysts - including Brownstone Research - anticipate the following at the July announcement: The official launch of Optimus Gen 3, Tesla''s third-generation humanoid robot A rollout plan for mass production, beginning with internal use in Tesla factories Metrics on robotic performance, capabilities, and deployment goals A likely update to the company''s neural network architecture for robotics Potential strategic partnerships or component sourcing announcements This is not simply a tech demo. Brownstone suggests this will be a commitment to scaled deployment, possibly at 12,000 units/year starting in 2026, with ambitious goals of scaling to 100,000+ monthly production by 2028. Why This Isn''t Just About Tesla Even if Tesla represents the first domino, Brownstone emphasizes that the impact of this event will extend far beyond one company. Here''s why: Tesla''s move may legitimize humanoid robotics for investors and enterprises Competing firms will accelerate their own timelines Supply chains (sensors, chips, AI tools) will see massive demand projections Robotics adoption will enter the enterprise mainstream - from logistics to healthcare It''s not just about what Tesla announces. It''s about how the entire technology industry will react, and how fast other dominoes will fall. See How Manifested AI Could Shape the Future of Work at BrownstoneResearch.com (Industry trends, real-world analysis, and expert breakdowns of Tesla''s role in AI robotics.) Core Technologies Behind Manifested AI To understand how humanoid robotics can function in the real world, Brownstone Research outlines five key technology domains that serve as the "brain, eyes, nervous system, muscles, and energy" of Manifested AI. These building blocks are what make intelligent embodiment possible in 2025. 1. Neural Network Architecture At the heart of every AI-powered robot is a neural network - an algorithm that mimics the way human brains process data. Unlike traditional robotics, which follows linear code execution, these networks can: Interpret dynamic data in real time Make decisions based on probabilistic reasoning Learn from past experiences and improve performance Generalize behavior to new environments Tesla''s proprietary Full Self-Driving (FSD) neural networks already analyze billions of miles of driving footage to detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and road edges. These same frameworks can be repurposed for humanoid navigation, object recognition, and multi-step task execution. "Robots powered by neural networks don''t just follow instructions - they adapt," Brownstone Research notes. "That''s the critical shift from 1990s factory robots to 2025 humanoid systems." 2. Multimodal Sensor Fusion For a robot to function in an unpredictable physical environment, it must collect and interpret real-time sensory data from multiple sources. This includes: High-resolution stereo vision cameras Depth sensors and ultrasonic proximity detection LIDAR or radar-based environmental mapping Tactile feedback sensors for grip and collision avoidance Microphones and speech recognition inputs Brownstone Research emphasizes that the fusion of these data streams into a single coherent "worldview" is what enables robots to make intelligent decisions in motion. Tesla''s extensive work with sensor calibration in its vehicle fleet - coupled with their AI labeling and simulation pipeline - gives them a major edge in this domain. 3. Locomotion and Dexterity Systems Unlike wheeled bots or robotic arms, humanoid AI systems must walk, balance, reach, and manipulate objects in the human world - often in narrow hallways, cluttered environments, or with soft materials. Tesla''s Optimus prototypes demonstrate: Bi-pedal walking with dynamic stability Articulated joint control for arms and hands Real-time rebalancing and fall recovery Load-bearing for lifting and transporting packages Their approach mimics the human musculoskeletal system using lightweight composite actuators, torque sensors for pressure regulation, and high-frequency feedback loops for fluid movement. Brownstone Research points out that robotic dexterity is where most competitors fall short, as it requires simultaneous mastery of mechanics, software, and safety protocols. 4. Onboard AI Processing (Edge Computing) Instead of offloading computations to the cloud, Tesla''s robots process information locally using custom-designed AI chips. This "edge computing" model is critical because: Physical reactions must occur in milliseconds Network latency in cloud-based systems is too slow for real-world safety Constant connectivity cannot be guaranteed in every environment Tesla''s D1 chip - originally built for Dojo training - and its inference engines allow real-time perception, motion planning, and decision logic to occur on-device, ensuring: Faster response times Lower power draw Greater reliability in offline scenarios Brownstone Research highlights this as one of the most scalable aspects of Tesla''s robotics model. 5. Battery and Power Systems A humanoid robot may consume between 400 to 700 watts of power depending on the task. Powering these machines safely and efficiently - without overheating or weight imbalance - is a major engineering challenge. Tesla brings: Over a decade of battery R&D Vertical integration of lithium-ion and LFP cells Advanced battery management software Cooling and structural housing technologies The same Gigafactories that produce Tesla vehicle batteries may soon produce robot battery packs, allowing mass deployment at previously unimaginable cost-efficiency. Why Tesla''s "Full Stack" Strategy Could Accelerate Adoption Brownstone Research argues that Tesla''s unique end-to-end control over every major subsystem of robotics gives it a crucial first-mover advantage. Most robotics companies rely on: Third-party chips (NVIDIA, Qualcomm) Open-source AI models Purchased batteries Contract manufacturing Cloud-based training platforms By contrast, Tesla controls: AI architecture (Dojo + FSD stack) Hardware (custom actuators + chassis) Software (proprietary OS, motion logic) Training data (billions of hours from real-world sensors) Manufacturing (global Giga production lines) Distribution (in-house logistics and support) "It''s not just that Tesla is building a robot," says Brownstone Research. "It''s that they''re building the supply chain, the software ecosystem, the training infrastructure, and the energy systems needed to scale that robot." Projected Features of Optimus Gen 3 Based on leaks, patent filings, and teardown analysis, Brownstone Research expects Tesla''s third-generation humanoid robot to include: Height: 5''8" - 5''10" Weight: 130-160 lbs Payload: Up to 45 lbs Battery Life: 4-6 hours per charge Actuators: 28+ degrees of freedom Connectivity: WiFi, Bluetooth, and fallback mesh networking Interface: Touchscreen, voice commands, gesture control Safety: Redundant limiters, force sensors, fallback protocols While these features may evolve, they provide a sense of how real-world-ready Tesla''s robots aim to be. Discover the Core Technologies Powering Tesla''s Robotics Program (Explore the full Manifested AI breakdown now available at BrownstoneResearch.com.) The AI-Enabled Factory: Tesla''s Internal Deployment Strategy Brownstone believes Tesla will first deploy robots inside its own factories, giving them: Real-world task data for faster AI training Safe, structured environments to refine edge cases Vertical feedback loops between R&D and deployment Manufacturing synergy between human and robot labor Robots may initially assist in: Assembly line support Warehouse movement Quality inspection Repetitive part handling Night-shift operations This strategy avoids the liability and uncertainty of public spaces while still generating billions of usable training hours for scaling to commercial deployments in 2026 and beyond. How Optimus Differs from Past Robotics Attempts Brownstone Research outlines three reasons why Tesla''s program stands apart from legacy robotics efforts: Purpose-Built AI Stack Most prior humanoids (e.g., Honda ASIMO, SoftBank Pepper) used rigid programming and lacked the adaptability of modern neural networks. Tesla''s bots are designed to learn and evolve. Scalable Energy Infrastructure Most historical robotics platforms failed at power management. Tesla''s battery supply chain and cooling tech solve this problem at industrial scale. Market Timing In 2025, the convergence of labor shortages, AI maturity, and declining hardware costs makes humanoid robotics viable for the first time in history. The Projected $25 Trillion Robotics Opportunity Brownstone Research''s most discussed projection is the potential for the humanoid robotics sector - powered by Manifested AI - to reach a total market value of $25 trillion. While bold, the projection is based on scalable unit economics, mass market applicability, and the fundamental reshaping of labor systems worldwide. How They Arrived at the $25 Trillion Estimate The estimate is derived from the following assumptions: A global demand for 1 billion humanoid robots over the next two decades An average unit price of $25,000 (dropping from early pricing over time) Widespread adoption across commercial, industrial, and consumer markets Expansion of entire ecosystems: AI training, robotics components, servicing, software, and maintenance Brownstone emphasizes that even if adoption reaches only 10% of the projected total, the resulting market value would still exceed $2.5 trillion - rivaling today''s entire global automotive industry. Historical Comparisons: How Big Is This Really? For perspective: The global smartphone industry is valued at approximately $500 billion annually The personal computer industry peaked at $300 billion in annual revenues The commercial robotics sector (pre-humanoid) is estimated at $70 billion today A fully integrated humanoid robotics economy would combine hardware, software, servicing, cloud integration, and labor replacement - multiplying its commercial footprint well beyond traditional technology categories. Key Market Drivers Supporting the Projection Global labor shortages in manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics Advancements in AI models that reduce training costs per robot Rapid miniaturization and cost reduction of sensors and processors Consumer acceptance of AI-driven products (e.g., Alexa, Roomba, Tesla) Political appetite for reshoring critical production functions via automation As of mid-2025, these factors are converging faster than in previous technological cycles. Sector Disruption: Who Stands to Be Transformed First? Brownstone Research identifies the sectors likely to be impacted in three major phases: Phase 1: Industrial & Factory Deployment (2025-2027) Automotive assembly Electronics and battery production Industrial packaging Warehousing and fulfillment These environments are structured, repetitive, and benefit from 24/7 robotic labor. Phase 2: Healthcare, Hospitality, and Services (2027-2032) Elder care and physical assistance Hospital logistics and support Hotels and restaurants (room service, cleaning, guest handling) Security and front-desk concierge roles These jobs require adaptability, emotional intelligence, and safe human interaction - a sweet spot for Manifested AI systems trained on natural language and facial recognition data. Phase 3: Consumer Adoption (2032 onward) Personal assistants and home robots Elderly companionship Child tutoring and monitoring Smart kitchen and cleaning automation At-home rehabilitation and physical therapy Consumer use will follow a similar trajectory to personal computers and smartphones - from early adopters to mass household presence over a 10- to 15-year horizon.

Economic Implications Beyond Technology Brownstone''s report doesn''t just analyze the hardware - it looks at macroeconomic impacts, too: 1. Labor Displacement vs. Repositioning While automation raises concerns about job loss, it also creates new categories of employment in: Robot maintenance AI training and oversight Human-robot interface design Ethical regulation and safety testing Logistics, engineering, and QA Brownstone compares this shift to the industrial revolution - where entire sectors were displaced, but millions of new roles were created. 2. National Infrastructure Shifts Governments may begin investing in: Robotics deployment incentives Retraining programs for displaced workers AI regulatory frameworks Ethical AI standards and liability structures Tax frameworks for non-human labor productivity Brownstone''s analysis shows that nations leading in robotics deployment may gain a geopolitical edge similar to past technology arms races. 3. Insurance, Legal, and Compliance Structures As robots enter public and private spaces: Liability will shift toward manufacturers or operators Insurance products will emerge for AI safety and malfunction Compliance will expand beyond GDPR to include movement tracking, voice recording, and behavior modeling Brownstone urges companies to start developing legal frameworks early - not retroactively. Geographic Trends: Who Leads, Who Follows Asia-Pacific Japan and South Korea are already leaders in robotics, aging care, and AI China is accelerating public-private AI robotics investment and production zones North America The U.S. is poised for leadership via Tesla, Boston Dynamics, and military contracts Brownstone forecasts a robotics boom tied to reshoring and industrial AI deployment Europe Germany and Scandinavia lead in precision automation and safety testing EU compliance rules may shape global AI behavior standards Latin America & Africa Leapfrogging risk: These regions may skip legacy industrial phases and go directly to humanoid robotics in logistics and public service Read the Global Robotics Adoption Map at BrownstoneResearch.com (Available now with full breakdown of regional manufacturing trends.) Projected Timeline for Humanoid Robotics Penetration 2025: Factory use begins - Tesla leads with internal deployment 2026-2028: Commercial deployment accelerates - especially in logistics and warehouses 2028-2032: Healthcare and hospitality become major growth verticals 2032-2035: First large-scale consumer robotics products hit mainstream adoption 2035+: Robotics reaches saturation and begins replacing household appliances altogether The Global Ripple Effect of Manifested AI As Brownstone Research notes, the rise of humanoid robotics isn''t just a technical evolution - it''s a global transformation that will influence industrial strategy, labor markets, and geopolitical priorities for decades. Tesla''s July 2025 announcement may simply be the first domino in a massive multi-continent shift. Manufacturing Supply Chains Will Be Redefined Companies that manufacture robotics-related components will likely see exponential demand over the next 10 years. These include: Semiconductor firms specializing in edge AI chips LIDAR and sensor developers High-torque actuator suppliers Advanced material producers for lightweight frames Battery and thermal management vendors Brownstone Research forecasts that many of today''s niche robotics suppliers may become household names within three to five years, similar to how NVIDIA emerged during the early AI boom. Training Infrastructure Becomes a National Priority For humanoid robots to improve, they must be trained on massive datasets - video, language, behavior patterns, and edge-case failure scenarios. Tesla''s Dojo system currently leads in this area, but Brownstone anticipates competition emerging in the form of: Government-sponsored training systems (EU, China, U.S.) Publicly regulated AI datasets for safety standardization Private firms building synthetic data simulators for robotics R&D Much like national space programs in the 1960s, manifested AI training infrastructure may become a metric of national innovation capacity. Job Markets Will Shift Dramatically As robots handle more manual and routine roles, job markets will evolve. Brownstone Research forecasts: Short-term resistance in labor-heavy sectors (unions, manufacturing belts, service economies) A medium-term migration toward "robot-adjacent" careers: AI supervision, robotics UX, software training, regulatory compliance, robotics repair Long-term emergence of hybrid work environments where humans and robots collaborate in manufacturing, logistics, and care settings One surprising finding from Brownstone''s interviews with robotics developers: most companies are actively seeking new human-robot cooperation models - not full replacement. Learn How Robots and Workers May Coexist at BrownstoneResearch.com (Read the full AI workforce integration report.) Policy, Regulation, and Ethics Will Lag Then Accelerate As AI-powered robots become integrated into physical spaces, lawmakers will face growing pressure to create ethical frameworks, including: Rules around facial recognition, audio recording, and privacy Physical safety thresholds (e.g., maximum movement speed or lifting limits) Behavioral guidelines for consumer-facing robots Certification or licensing for humanoid systems in medical or child-care environments Taxation models for robot labor vs. human labor Brownstone believes the EU is likely to lead in establishing ethical AI policies, with the U.S. following via industry self-regulation unless prompted by major incidents. Competitive Landscape: Who Else Is Chasing Tesla? While Tesla may dominate headlines, Brownstone Research highlights several companies poised to compete in the manifested AI revolution. Boston Dynamics (Hyundai) Known for its Spot and Atlas robots, Boston Dynamics has unmatched dexterity and balance capabilities. Their Atlas prototype has already demonstrated backflips and complex obstacle navigation. Strength: Physical motion and dynamic control Weakness: Lacks Tesla''s software/data ecosystem Current Focus: Logistics and industrial automation Figure AI A California-based startup backed by major venture capital. Figure is developing general-purpose humanoid robots for commercial tasks. Strength: Lean, purpose-built team with agility Weakness: Limited manufacturing scale Current Focus: Partnerships with warehouses and logistics firms Agility Robotics Makers of the Digit robot, designed for package delivery and back-room retail automation. Strength: Focused on real-world logistics Weakness: B2B niche focus, limited general-purpose ability Current Focus: Amazon pilot projects Amazon & Google Both companies have robotics arms focused on warehouse automation, AI assistants, and experimental mobility. Strength: Data, distribution, cloud dominance Weakness: Less focused on humanoid embodiment Current Focus: Assistive robotics and voice-based interfaces China''s Robotics Push Several Chinese firms are developing humanoid robots for factory and logistics use, often supported by regional government subsidies. Strength: Rapid iteration and government funding Weakness: Limited global trust and export restrictions Current Focus: Domestic manufacturing automation Key Differentiators for Tesla According to Brownstone Research, Tesla holds the advantage in three critical areas: Real-World Data Tesla has billions of hours of driving and sensor footage - unmatched for training navigation and object recognition models. Mass Manufacturing The company''s experience in producing complex machines at scale gives it a massive head start. Most robotics firms are still at the prototype or small-batch stage. Unified Hardware/Software Stack Tesla designs its own chips, trains its own models, and runs its own firmware. This end-to-end control eliminates latency and integration bottlenecks. Compare the Leading Robotics Companies at BrownstoneResearch.com (See the side-by-side chart of Tesla, Boston Dynamics, Figure AI, and more.) The Race Has Started - But the Finish Line Is Far Away Brownstone emphasizes that no single company will dominate the entire $25 trillion robotics economy. The sector is too broad and complex - spanning hardware, software, services, ethics, and training infrastructure. Instead, the next decade will likely unfold as: Tesla leads in full-stack humanoid integration Agile competitors dominate niche roles and early deployments Ecosystem companies (chipmakers, sensor firms, AI platforms) emerge as infrastructure giants Regulators attempt to keep pace with deployment speed The bottom line? Tesla''s announcement on July 23, 2025, may only be the beginning - but it could change the perception of humanoid robotics from science fiction to inevitability. Final Takeaways from Brownstone Research''s Manifested AI Report Brownstone Research''s analysis of Manifested AI and the anticipated Tesla Shock of 2025 highlights a global inflection point. What was once theoretical is now on the cusp of commercial reality. Here''s what the firm believes matters most: 1. Tesla''s July 2025 Announcement Will Mark a Real Shift The reveal of Optimus Gen 3 - and the corresponding mass production timeline - will legitimize humanoid robotics in the eyes of the industrial world. Much like the 2012 Model S redefined EVs, this event could redefine embodied AI. 2. The Market Opportunity Is Vast - But Not Instant While the $25 trillion market projection is based on long-term adoption, the early 2025-2030 window will be focused on infrastructure, logistics, and strategic deployment - not consumer availability. Expect phase-based growth, not overnight transformation. 3. Winners Will Be Those Who Build the Ecosystem Tesla is positioned as a first mover, but Brownstone forecasts that chipmakers, battery suppliers, vision sensor vendors, AI training platforms, and robotics software providers may see just as much upside - or more. 4. Regulation, Public Sentiment, and Safety Will Shape Adoption The public''s comfort with AI, privacy issues, physical safety, and legal frameworks will all influence how fast robots become part of daily life. Brownstone urges companies to engage proactively with lawmakers and ethicists. 5. The Race Has Begun - But the Finish Line Is 10-20 Years Away As with any frontier technology, the biggest returns may go to those who understand the cycles: hype → investment → infrastructure → saturation → normalization.

Led by the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification (OFME) and the Michigan Office of Defense and Aerospace Innovation (ODAI), in partnership with Centrepolis Accelerator at Lawrence Technological University, the program offers grant awards of up to $100,000 per company, with a total funding pool of $2 million available dedicated for product development of mobility technology. “The Make It in Michigan Mobility Prototyping Program is a critical part of our strategy to ensure Michigan remains the global leader for designing, engineering, and manufacturing next-generation mobility solutions,” said Justine Johnson, Chief Mobility Officer with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) . “This program will help us not only support Michigan-grown innovation but also attract best-in-class companies to engineer, build and scale their technologies right here in Michigan.” The grant program will provide technical services and financial support to startups and established companies working across all modes of mobility — air, ground, and sea — with a focus on uncrewed autonomous systems, critical mobility components addressing domestic supply chain gaps, and other breakthrough mobility innovations. Companies with technologies at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4 through 9 are eligible to apply. Preference will be given to applicants that commit to developing, piloting, and manufacturing their technologies in Michigan, particularly within OFME’s test site network, innovation districts, and defense innovation centers. The program also emphasizes dual-purpose technologies with both commercial and defense applications.  “This program supports technologies with the potential to serve both commercial and national defense needs — an essential focus of our work at ODAI,” said John Gutierrez, Executive Director of the Office of Defense and Aerospace Innovation . “We’re proud to back innovations that strengthen domestic supply chains, increase our national security capabilities, and drive defense-related economic growth here in Michigan.”  Dan Radomski, CEO of Centrepolis Accelerator , emphasized the program’s alignment with Centrepolis’ mission. “This initiative is about strengthening America’s domestic manufacturing capabilities and building a more resilient supply chain, starting here in Michigan,” he said. “By supporting product development, prototyping, and manufacturing readiness for innovative mobility and electrification technologies, we are ensuring critical technologies are developed, built, and scaled within the United States utilizing the value engineering capabilities unique to Michigan.”  The Michigan Mobility Prototyping grant program was established in 2024, attracting 86 applications from across the globe. A total of $828,000 in grants were awarded to 17 projects supporting a wide variety of mobility technologies from autonomous drone systems, electric vehicles and chargers, hydrogen generation, and storage systems.  Applications for this new round will open on May 28, 2025, with a deadline to apply by July 7, 2025. Final award selections are expected to be announced by Sept. 1, with projects set to begin in October.

Over the last decade, massive investments are taking shape in the form of robo-taxis and self-driving delivery vehicles, with more mobility options on the horizon. Now it’s up to policymakers and regulators to work out how autonomous vehicles may figure into the future of their cities.  Different approaches will yield different outcomes, and thoughtful planning and regulation are essential: No one wants flotillas of aimless AVs cruising city streets already choked with cars, bicycles, pedestrians, scooters, and e-bikes. State and local leaders need to determine their key objectives—such as fewer crashes, less parking demand, improved air quality, less congestion, and economic development—and how AVs can contribute to achieving them. A simulation done by the International Transport Forum illustrated how a large-scale deployment of shared vehicle fleets that provide on-demand transportation in a midsized city could eliminate congestion, reduce traffic emissions by a third, and require 95% less space for public parking. 1  Leaders should aim to understand the ways in which these vehicles—if introduced and overseen effectively—have the potential to reshape urban navigation for the public good. 2           Many questions remain unanswered in a dynamic mobility ecosystem, with technology rapidly changing and new players emerging as others exit the market. After a number of widely reported incidents, advocates have far to go in convincing the public at large that AVs can be safe and beneficial, 3 and some major companies have pulled back on their planned investments. There’s still plenty of skepticism among consumers, regulators, and the various ecosystem players. 4 And the unknowns have led some states and cities to wait for San Francisco, Phoenix, and other early AV adopters to work out the kinks.  The new administration appears to be supportive of a favorable regulatory environment that will accelerate AV adoption. 5 Moreover, manufacturers have solved some of the stickiest technical problems, and increasing visibility will likely boost acceptance, although grudging at first. All in all, the AV question has largely shifted from “ Will it happen?” to “ When and how will it happen?”                      Table of contents     Uncertainties in AVs    Leaders'' role in AV deployment    Where AV usage stands    Competing visions for AVs    Choices facing policymakers    Building trust    Looking ahead                                         How AVs can benefit cities          Cities stand to reap the benefits of AV deployment—with some already observed in tests and early operations and others expected with broader deployment. Some of the potential benefits include: 6  Safety: By removing human biases and driver errors, autonomous systems drive more reliably and improve safety for passengers and surrounding traffic: 85% observed a lower likelihood of Waymo AVs being involved in an injury-causing crash than the human-driving benchmark (upon analysis of 7 miles of Waymo AV operations in California and Nevada). 7 Economic and social: Automated mobility improves freight efficiencies, avoids costly interruptions (that is, crashes), and releases personal vehicle–oriented land uses. An estimated US$75 billion of potential annual economic savings can be achieved from reduced traffic incidents, along with associated injuries and fatalities—under a scenario with a 25% adoption rate of “standard” AVs. 8 Efficiency and convenience: AV platooning reduces congestion and returns time to roadway users. Forty percent observed reduction in fuel consumption, as well as 15% increase in vehicle throughput, due to the impact of AVs optimizing traffic flow and dissipating stop-and-go traffic patterns (achieved when AVs are just 5% of the overall fleet mix). 9 Mobility: AV systems carry enormous potential to reach seniors, people with disabilities, and other populations previously limited in personal mobility. There was approximately 10x estimated improvement in access to jobs, health care facilities, and education due to the impact of shared AV taxi and micro-transit fleets, measured by the ratio between the locations accessible in 30 minutes to the 10% best-served person to the 10% worst-served person. 10          Show more              How city and state leaders can help prepare for AV deployments  Right now, there’s a stubborn gap between capabilities and trust. 11 But government agencies and other industry participants have an opportunity to help close that gap through collaboration and transparency. In crafting regulatory guardrails and policy guidance, officials are likely to achieve their desired outcomes by proactively engaging the full range of stakeholders.  While responsibility for establishing testing standards lies with federal regulators, 12 it is state and city policymakers and regulators who have the authority to draw a road map for how a region’s citizens can best realize AVs’ benefits. As government embraces the next generation of community-facing technologies, their success—including that of AVs—is achieved when leaders bring to the forefront the fundamental needs and priorities of communities themselves.  Most states have passed AV legislation, largely focused on testing (figure 1): Twenty-five states explicitly allow for some level of AV deployment. While many of these state statutes permit testing on public roads, they often have their own individual nuances to address the particular needs, habits, and geographies of their jurisdictions and constituents. Within those states, early-adopter cities have taken different routes to make their streets safe for AVs, showing a range of possibilities for policymakers looking to create optimal deployment conditions.                   Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy                   Whether focusing on shared or individually owned AVs, ride-hailing, or package delivery, short commutes or long road trips, state and city leaders can explore policy options to avoid having other ecosystem players impose a future that may be far less aligned with their objectives. Consider how municipalities had to scramble to address the disruption of ride-hailing services after citizens had made those companies wildly popular. 13  Jeff Farrah, chief executive officer of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, observes that companies’ attitudes have shifted, as they move past early pilots toward broader deployment. “Rather than viewing the regulatory void as a license to operate, they now desire clear legislation or testing regimes,” says Farrah. 14 With AV innovations and commercial partnerships bringing technology ever nearer to more people, state and local governments have the opportunity to achieve the outcomes they want by designing a holistic regulatory and stakeholder engagement approach. Firm leadership—and a well-planned road map—can allow cities and states to harness the power of AVs to better constituents’ lives now and in the future.           Who’s (not) driving today: Where AV usage stands  Since 1983, when the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched the Autonomous Land Vehicle program, as part of its Strategic Computing Program AI initiative, public sector institutions have helped guide several waves of AV technological breakthroughs. Along the way, corporate investments have gathered momentum, through the first commercial autonomous ride-hailing vehicles in 2018, 15 and legacy automakers competing with tech giants to make AVs ready for city streets.  Recently, some large companies and investors have accelerated capital spending, 16 even as others have tapped the brakes in favor of other tech horizons, particularly generative AI. 17 Chinese investors have overtaken their US counterparts in funding the sector. 18 And with AI applications expanding, some mobility startups are attracting unexpected investment. 19 Overall, AV investment is expected to grow from US$57 billion in 2021 to upwards of US$788 billion by 2028. 20  Today’s AV landscape, then, is a little unsettled, with players regularly entering and leaving the mobility ecosystem, and those that remain exploring a range of different business models (figure 2). Policymakers have had to regularly reassess who their private sector partners are, and what vehicles and technologies those partners might be looking to introduce—including what degree of autonomy future AVs might feature (see “ How autonomous is autonomous? ”). But analysts see renewed momentum in the “autonomy economy,” with more investments and skyrocketing market size, 21 despite tepid growth forecasts for US autonomous vehicle sales over the next decade—a market share of less than 1.5% by 2034. 22                   Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy               How autonomous is autonomous?          As policymakers working on AV regulations quickly learn, there are varying degrees of self-driving , with differing ramifications for how states and cities set up guardrails and incentives. SAE International defines six levels of vehicle autonomy, widely adopted across industry and US government agencies (figure 3):  Level 0: No driving automation  Level 1: Driver assistance  Level 2: Partial driving automation  Level 3: Conditional driving automation  Level 4: High driving automation  Level 5: Full driving automation               Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy              Show more              No one should be surprised by automakers’ start-stop-start-stop progress toward AV deployment: Making self-driving cars safe and efficient in a dense urban environment involves tremendous complexity (figure 4). As Jamey Tesler, former secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, observes, “Unlike many other heavily regulated industries, transportation is a ubiquitous good. Everyone uses the system every day. A common thread across all new mobility technology—from e-bikes to AVs—is that they need to be tested and piloted not just for safety, but for consumer awareness and political legitimacy.” 23 To avoid some of the same potholes that previous mobility innovations entering the market hit, AV deployments demand close coordination with other players, especially public sector officials and policymakers responsible for keeping traffic moving and everyone safe.                   Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy                   Policymakers and regulators have an integral role to play in shaping the AV landscape. City and state leaders want to consider a holistic view of the overall landscape and to understand how changes in the capabilities, incentives, or attitudes of any of the stakeholders—whether tech developers, automakers, fleet operators, network providers, or end users—could alter how AV regulations might need to shift. There are, for instance, open questions about the viability of different AV business models. Even with improving technology, the operational and business case is challenging for at-scale AV deployment. Many firms have a limited timeframe to achieve commercial sustainability, and this pressure influences the pace and scale of their commercial expansion. More than a decade after Zipcar founder Robin Chase outlined two—“heaven or hell”—trajectories for AV deployment, 24 state and local governments can leverage business partners—and business models—that align with their objectives.           An overview of the US autonomous vehicle market          For cities, the AV landscape involves six primary stakeholders and an array of secondary players, who have different responsibilities.  Governing bodies: Governing bodies across federal, state, and local jurisdictions who strive to guide development and implementation to best serve the public: Enable safe, secure transportation and communication infrastructure Uphold shared responsibilities (publishing standards, guidelines, etc.) Ensure attestation and enforcement Refine legislation and support economic development  Technology developers: Commercial tech providers and research organizations focused on developing technical components of AVs and refining them to adhere to standards: Innovate technical components for efficiency, reliability, and safety Integrate service centers into software and hardware Ensure end-to-end cybersecurity Encrypt connected devices and secure the code of onboard units  Auto manufacturers: Traditional auto manufacturers and new organizations established solely for autonomous vehicles: Strengthen technical manufacturing relationships for complete, secure component integration Adhere to existing broader motor-vehicle stations (for example, safety standards)  Fleet operators: Organizations that manage the use, upkeep, logistics, and oversight of AVs; connect the finished product to customer-facing services (network provider): Track efficient location, speed, and status to boost efficiencies and performance Manage adherence to compliance and safety requirements Monitor fuel use, maintenance schedules, and driver patterns to lower operational costs  Network providers: Operations that connect a product (that is, a car) to operations within the context of social, regulatory, and infrastructural environments: Ensure service availability and connectivity Provide channels for two-way communications with users (for example, announcements, guidelines, feedback, concerns) Understand and adhere to jurisdictional requirements and restrictions  End users: Passengers or firms primarily seeking access to safe, reliable, and efficient alternative modes of transportation: Enjoy AV services as designed, without intentionally threatening performance Adhere to user-focused regulations and guidelines Provide feedback about system performance             Show more              Of all the stakeholders, end users may have the veto power: If the vast majority of people remain unwilling to climb into a self-driving car, adoption—and investment—will likely hit a wall, and the benefits that broad AV usage could bring for states and cities may never materialize. And even though safety has improved, with only a handful of fatal crashes over millions of test miles, multiple surveys suggest that consumer apprehension has increased markedly just when automakers were hoping to dispel fears. An annual American Automobile Association survey shows the number of Americans who characterize themselves as “afraid” of AVs rising from 54% in 2021 to 66% in 2024. 25  The key players, especially those who have invested billions in AV technology, are very much aware of the problem. In April 2024, the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association unveiled a set of five principles aimed at shoring up public trust: transparent interactions with government officials and the public, responsible AV integration into communities and deep engagement with law enforcement and first responders, upholding high cybersecurity and privacy standards, establishing safety-first culture and governance, and advocating policies to boost public trust. 26  The public sector is integral to all of these principles. Realizing the potential public benefits of AVs, from reducing congestion to aiding senior mobility to boosting businesses that lack parking, will require both regulators and automakers to take action to build confidence in vehicle safety and security. That means far more than pointing out that driverless cars have fewer crashes per mile than human drivers 27  it will involve agencies working with stakeholders across the AV landscape to coordinate policy and communication, aligning players’ interests to keep everyone moving in the same direction.  Some of that alignment has already taken place. Across the United States, regulators have set up state guidelines for AV testing and deployment, and both agencies and companies have piloted AV projects in all but a few states (figure 5). Policymakers and regulators at all levels of government, from federal to local, need to coordinate to ensure that rules don’t conflict.                   Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy                   Government leaders can study early-adopter states to understand how their policy assumptions and frameworks influenced AV testing and deployment on actual city streets.  California was an early adopter in US AV innovation, with state-driven legislation and fast-moving pilot programs for rideshare services. There has been tension with local governments over top-down regulatory approaches, especially after a widely reported San Francisco crash and pedestrian injury brought federal investigations and popular backlash. 28 California cities are pushing for more control over AV policy as well as greater data transparency. 29  Since the 2015 executive order that established guidelines for AV testing, Arizona has become a hub for AV technology, with widespread AV testing and deployment, including personal delivery devices and truck platooning. 30 In 2022, state legislators established driverless, low-speed AVs as a new vehicle category. But software issues have forced automakers to recall some of these vehicles, 31 and federal investigators are looking into traffic incidents. 32  As governments prepare for an era of at-scale autonomous vehicles, even early leaders like California and Arizona are reconsidering key assumptions and policy frameworks.           Competing visions for AVs in the city  We see states following one of three approaches in AV research, testing, and deployment: state-level control, local control, or a hybrid of the two. Each approach features distinct levels of regulatory flexibility across policy domains, with different jurisdictional levers appropriate to states’ particular AV markets.  No matter which AV protocol states and cities adopt, leading policy practices are consistent:  Clear ownership and accountability: Establish clear terms for incident liability across the vehicle’s original equipment manufacturer, AV technology provider, or fleet manager; develop robust insurance requirements, indemnity provisions, and risk protocols to help ensure that responsible parties take appropriate action and sufficiently resolve issues. Uniform standards: Develop and enforce consistent standards across federal, state, and (if possible) local levels to avoid regulatory patchwork; enact legislation that can evolve with technological advancements and emerging safety data. Public-private partnerships and community engagement: Create opportunities for cross-sector deliberation and demonstration of AV technology; engage the public through pilot programs, such as autonomous shuttles for sporting events, to gather feedback and build trust. Data-sharing and privacy protections: Establish robust data privacy and reporting protocols between AV companies and regulatory bodies to monitor and ensure safety while protecting consumer data and proprietary business information. Infrastructure and workforce readiness: Invest in  programs that prepare the workforce for technological and regulatory changes in the transportation industry. While connected infrastructure is not a prerequisite for safe AV deployment, investment in smart infrastructure, such as connected traffic signals, can support AV operations.  Measures of success are consistent as well, including:  Safety and compliance: High compliance rates with regulations; reduction in crash rates, injuries, and fatalities; and high implementation rate of robust inspection protocols. Mobility: Improved traffic flow and reduced congestion, as well as enhanced transportation options for underserved and disadvantaged communities. Economic environmental impact: Creation of new jobs; increased investment in research and development and the workforce; operational efficiency gains; and reduction in emissions, fuel consumption, and pollution. Public acceptance: Increased public trust in AV technology and future initiatives.  State-level control  In a state-led regulatory environment, frameworks typically evolve as municipalities report differing impacts, even with limited agency. As AV use matures and scales, state-level regulatory frameworks may be considered, which could impact local governments’ control. Perhaps unsurprisingly, AV companies have an easier time with centralized and streamlined policymaking; if state agencies sign off on allowing testing and even limited deployment, automakers can proceed without local government. More freedom, and clearly defined regulatory guardrails, can generate innovation and insights, accelerating breakthroughs. And state investment in AV-supportive infrastructure can improve safety along with public perception and acceptance.  Communities and local governments are less enamored with state preemption of AV regulation, especially considering the wide range of urban, suburban, and rural environments in every state.  Local control  In jurisdictions where AV initiatives may be city- or county-led, local governments have more autonomy to permit AV testing and deployment. In these jurisdictions, communication and coordination are key for regulators and policymakers locally and statewide. While the absence of a statewide policy may reduce regulatory overhead, leaving space for AV companies to operate, discontinuities across localities can create uncertainty and limit the ability to mature and scale. Companies, communities, and local governments can collaborate across cities to develop a comprehensive approach.  Locally specific regulation carries benefits and challenges for all parties. While leaders can fashion AV policies to suit a community’s specific geography and demographics—and promote street-level public-private partnerships—those policies can be susceptible to swings in public sentiment, potentially derailing ongoing plans and investments by both providers and agencies. To promote greater stability, local officials and policymakers can assess how industry objectives might align with lasting community goals. To avoid drastic variations in legislation and deter industry from launching pilots and initiatives, municipalities can look to collaborate with similar, peer communities on AV research and policy development.  State-local hybrid approach  Some states have adopted a hybrid approach to regulation and policy, wherein AV activities are regulated at the state level and additional local oversight is permitted or encouraged, with state agencies deferring a subset of policy decisions to localities.  State-level legislation may catalyze follow-along legislation  at the local level, permitting regulatory continuity and policymaking efficiencies across localities. In some cases, there has been increased collaboration between state government, municipalities, and manufacturers that specialize in research, design, and deployment. Cities’ partnerships with AV rideshare  companies can speed innovation and illustrate how service can integrate into communities, as a model—or a cautionary tale—for other municipalities in the state.  Coordination is key: Uncertain regulatory environments and nonuniform frameworks between local and state governments can create a patchwork model of engagement for technology companies. Potential conflicts on operating limitations between regulators at different levels can leave the AV operating environment unsettled.           Choices facing public policymakers  According to Mark Fagan of Harvard Kennedy School’s Autonomous Vehicles Policy Initiative, "State-level policy preemption is here and not going anywhere. But the goal should be to allow communities to have greater influence on implementation speed and scale in the future.” 33 That influence can be exerted in many ways. In assessing possibilities over the years to come—and the potential benefits to citizens, businesses, and the environment—regulators and policymakers need to grapple with a host of issues to ensure that AV use is on the right track (figure 6). Each policy area requires a particular blend of oversight and collaboration with public and private entities.                   Share image           Share       linkedin       twitter       facebook         Or copy link    Copy                   Cities are, of course, surpassingly complex entities, differing in ways that often only locals can see. Intentional AV implementation requires regulatory strategy rooted in each municipality’s realities and needs. Regardless of jurisdictional power, city leaders first need to decide the role they want AVs to play on their streets—and the role that they want to have in the AVs’ eventual deployment. These decisions could lead to vastly different outcomes for all stakeholders.  Introducing AVs into any city environment involves great unpredictability, but some impacts are likely: AV deployment will increase traffic complexity, at least temporarily, as drivers, pedestrians, cyclists, and others adjust to a new form of mobility; replacing drivers of any vehicle type with automated systems will introduce second-order effects, whether in citizens’ travel behaviors, patterns of business activity, the timing of rush hour, or other changes; and AV use will have impacts on safety, the environment, public health, landscape, and vehicle ownership.  Policymakers—even those who know their cities better than anyone—are not likely to be able to foresee the full scope of what introducing AVs might do to each of these players and systems, much less to a multilayered city ecosystem. 34 What leaders can consider is which variables they need to factor in and allow space for—and which are thus far unknown and unknowable. State and city regulators may wish to consider a long list of questions before finalizing AV policies. For many identified areas, policymakers may want to lead with determining whether AVs can be treated simply like traditional motor vehicles or whether regulators need to specify limited accommodations or innovative rethinking of current frameworks.  As it turns out, local officials may have more control than they assume. For example, with regard to AV deployment, city officials can exercise policy levers relating to roadway design, data-sharing, and pricing. If they regulate all vehicles and for-hire services, local authorities can still comply with state rules. By addressing AV issues within broader policy frameworks, localities can maintain their own voice even when the state has issued its own comprehensive AV plan. In the face of risks and uncertainties about how AVs might ultimately affect urban mobility and society, local government leaders need to take a proactive approach to defining objectives and asserting their influence—regulatory, political, and informal—to create the future they want.           Questions for regulators to consider          In formulating AV policy, questions across a range of known risks and issues will impact decision-making.  Licensing, permits, and registration How will AVs be identified and tracked by authorities? How will permits be issued and monitored to ensure compliance? Should there be a special license for individuals or companies operating fleets? What permits and registration processes are necessary for testing and deploying?

Anduril’s Revolutionary AI Grand Prix: The Genius Recruitment Contest Where Autonomous Drones Win Jobs AI News Defense Technology Recruitment Anduril AI Competition Autonomous Drones  Jan, 27, 2026 6  min read by  Keshav Aggarwal  for  Bitcoin World Share : BitcoinWorld   Anduril’s Revolutionary AI Grand Prix: The Genius Recruitment Contest Where Autonomous Drones Win Jobs  In a bold move reshaping defense technology recruitment, Anduril Industries has launched the groundbreaking AI Grand Prix—an autonomous drone racing competition where software engineering prowess directly translates to career opportunities and substantial financial rewards. This innovative event, announced October 2025, represents a paradigm shift in how defense contractors identify and attract top artificial intelligence talent through practical demonstration rather than traditional interviews.  Anduril’s AI Grand Prix: Redefining Defense Tech Recruitment  Palmer Luckey’s vision for the AI Grand Prix emerged from a fundamental realization about autonomous systems development. During strategic recruitment discussions, Anduril’s founder recognized that sponsoring conventional drone racing contradicted the company’s core mission. “Our entire impetus centers on autonomy advancing beyond human micromanagement,” Luckey explained to Bitcoin World. Consequently, the team conceived a competition testing programmers’ ability to make drones fly independently.  The competition structure features three qualifying rounds beginning April 2026, culminating in a November final event in Ohio. Remarkably, participants won’t operate Anduril’s own drones but will program Neros Technologies’ racing quadcopters. This decision stems from practical considerations—Anduril’s defense-focused drones prove too large for the contained Ohio course. The company partners with established organizations including the Drone Champions League and JobsOhio to execute this ambitious event.  Autonomous Drone Racing Mechanics and Competition Details  The AI Grand Prix operates on fundamentally different principles than traditional drone racing. Teams develop sophisticated software enabling drones to navigate complex courses without human intervention. This approach tests multiple AI capabilities including real-time obstacle avoidance, optimal pathfinding, and adaptive flight control. The competition format emphasizes practical engineering skills over theoretical knowledge.  Key competition elements include:   Autonomous Navigation Systems: Drones must interpret course layouts and environmental variables independently  Real-Time Decision Making: Software must process sensor data and adjust flight parameters within milliseconds  Energy Optimization: Efficient algorithms extend operational duration and improve performance  Fault Tolerance: Systems must maintain functionality despite unexpected conditions or partial failures   Anduril anticipates at least 50 teams from universities and research institutions worldwide. The company has structured substantial incentives including a $500,000 prize pool distributed among top performers. Most significantly, exceptional participants receive direct job offers bypassing Anduril’s standard recruitment pipeline. This approach mirrors emerging trends in technology hiring where demonstrated capability outweighs conventional credentials.  Strategic Implications for Defense Technology Development  The AI Grand Prix represents more than an isolated recruitment event—it signals broader shifts in defense technology priorities. Autonomous systems increasingly dominate military planning across global powers. By focusing competition on software rather than hardware, Anduril emphasizes the critical importance of algorithmic superiority in modern warfare. This approach acknowledges that advanced platforms prove ineffective without sophisticated control systems.  Industry analysts note the competition’s timing coincides with accelerated autonomous weapons development. Major defense contractors increasingly prioritize AI integration across land, sea, air, and space domains. Anduril’s event specifically addresses talent shortages in autonomous systems engineering—a critical bottleneck affecting multiple defense sectors. The competition format allows direct assessment of candidates’ abilities to solve complex, real-world problems under competitive pressure.  Geopolitical Considerations and International Participation  Anduril has implemented selective participation policies reflecting current geopolitical realities. While welcoming international teams generally, the company explicitly excludes Russian participants. Luckey clarified this decision parallels World Cup exclusion policies, citing Russia’s ongoing military actions in Europe. The concern centers on potential competitors’ affiliations with foreign military programs.  Interestingly, Chinese teams remain eligible despite strategic competition between Washington and Beijing in autonomous weapons development. Luckey acknowledged this apparent contradiction while noting practical limitations. “If you work for the Chinese military, you’re not going to be allowed to get a job at Anduril,” he stated, referencing existing legal restrictions. All job candidates undergo standard vetting regardless of competition performance.  The participation framework reveals nuanced approaches to international technology competition. While seeking global talent, defense contractors must balance innovation against security considerations. This tension increasingly characterizes technology sectors with dual-use applications. The AI Grand Prix navigates these complexities through transparent eligibility criteria and compliance with export control regulations.  Future Expansion and Autonomous Systems Evolution  Success with the inaugural AI Grand Prix could trigger expansion into additional autonomous domains. Luckey envisions future competitions involving underwater vehicles, ground systems, and potentially spacecraft. This progression aligns with Anduril’s broader portfolio spanning multiple operational environments. Each domain presents unique challenges requiring specialized AI approaches.   Potential Future AI Racing Categories   Domain  Key Challenges  Military Applications    Underwater  Limited communication, pressure effects  Mine detection, submarine tracking    Ground  Terrain navigation, obstacle avoidance  Logistics, reconnaissance, combat support    Aerial  Current competition focus  Surveillance, electronic warfare, strike    Space  Orbital mechanics, radiation hardening  Satellite servicing, debris removal    This expansion strategy acknowledges diverse autonomous system requirements across military operations. Different environments demand specialized sensor suites, propulsion systems, and control algorithms. By exploring multiple domains, Anduril cultivates expertise transferable between platforms. The company’s approach reflects comprehensive understanding of autonomous warfare’s multidimensional nature.  Broader Industry Impact and Recruitment Innovation  The AI Grand Prix establishes precedents potentially influencing technology recruitment broadly. Traditional hiring processes often struggle evaluating candidates’ practical problem-solving abilities. Competition-based assessment provides direct observation of skills under realistic conditions. This methodology proves particularly valuable for autonomous systems where theoretical knowledge insufficiently predicts real-world performance.  Other defense contractors monitor Anduril’s experiment closely. Successful outcomes could inspire similar initiatives across the sector. The competition format offers multiple advantages including public engagement, talent identification, and technology demonstration. Additionally, events generate valuable data about autonomous system capabilities under stress conditions—information difficult obtaining through conventional testing.  Educational institutions increasingly align curricula with competition requirements. Universities recognize value preparing students for practical challenges beyond academic exercises. This alignment benefits both industry and academia by closing gaps between theoretical education and operational requirements. The AI Grand Prix thus influences talent development pipelines beyond immediate recruitment objectives.  Conclusion  Anduril’s AI Grand Prix represents a transformative approach to defense technology recruitment and autonomous systems development. By creating competitive environments where software engineering excellence determines success, the company identifies talent capable of advancing next-generation autonomous platforms. This innovative strategy addresses critical industry needs while establishing new paradigms for evaluating technical capabilities. As autonomous systems assume increasingly prominent military roles, initiatives like the AI Grand Prix will prove essential cultivating necessary expertise. The competition’s outcomes will influence not only Anduril’s recruitment but broader approaches to autonomous warfare development across defense sectors.

By:  Financial Tech Times  • Markets Konnex , the permissionless market for decentralized autonomous labor, aims to transform the contracting, verification, and payment of robot-led physical work. To realize its vision, Konnex successfully closed a $15 million funding round backed by a group of industry veterans and VCs. The team of strategic investment partners included Cogitent Ventures, Liquid Capital, Leland Ventures, Covey, M77 Ventures, and Block Maven LLC. The funding round will boost Konnex to tap into the $25 trillion physical work economy by enabling autonomous robots to function like seamless app ecosystems. Creating a Market for Robots Autonomous systems and consumer-grade robots have the necessary hardware but lack the intelligence and communication systems for real-world physical labor. At the same time, sophisticated AI tools don’t have the incentive structure to monetize and share their intelligence solutions. Put simply, robots remain isolated with no shared mechanism to request work, verify outcomes, and access payments. Konnex connects these robots to a decentralized Robotic-AI network, thereby creating a neutral market for robots to take on jobs and get paid in stablecoins. Each task is broadcast to AI miners, and robots sign Proof-of-Physical-Work (PoPW) smart contracts to solve complex tasks. PoPW helps independent validators audit sensor-based evidence reports, prove outcomes, and automatically disburse payments. Konnex thus brings together AI, robotics, and crypto to unlock unprecedented innovation in emerging tech. No wonder the protocol is led by Jon Ollwerther (CEO), Brandon Torres Declet (Strategic Supporter), and Lucas Van Oostrum (Strategic Advisor), all of whom are vastly experienced in robotics, drone tech, and capital markets. Funding a Robot-led Labor Economy Konnex’s $15 million funding round will infuse fresh capital into the platform for its expansion plans, integration with new hardware partners, and the development of verification systems. This will enable autonomous systems to operate safely and efficiently in real-world conditions. Currently, the $25 trillion physical work economy is a siloed system, with value locked in closed chambers. After the funding support, Konnex will develop infrastructure to tap into the work economy where autonomous systems and robots can function like apps. Instead of isolated proprietary systems, Konnex is creating an environment where robots can be easily contracted, verified onchain, and paid instantly, like apps, to provide scalable physical labour for real-world services. Konnex’s ‘Robotics-as-a-Service’ guarantees labor is deployable and scalable with the same ease and fluidity as software. The liquidity influx will help Konnex break the barriers of labor and ensure the physical work economy doesn’t remain in silos. Put differently, Konnex has transformed robot labor into on-chain liquidity and is building the GDP of autonomous systems. At a time when widely available sensors, AI computing, and predictable stablecoin payment rails have become the norm, Konnex is providing the market infrastructure where labour’s value can compound. In many ways, Konnex is changing the definition and future of work opportunities. By bridging the space between autonomous robotics, real-world labor, and the global economy, Konnex is treating autonomous robotic labor as a verifiable liquid asset. The latest strategic funding round from high-conviction investors will give yet another push to Konnex and the broader tech industry for deploying crypto-powered robotic solutions simply and transparently.

They discuss the country''s focus on embodied AI and robotics as a potential path to AGI, multilevel government initiatives supporting this development, a large-scale social simulator project in Wuhan, and significant investments in power grid and data center infrastructure.

I have no idea what time of day you are listening to this episode. So I don''t want to suggest that my intake of caffeine bears any relationship to what our audience may be imbibing at this time. But welcome to Paul Weiss''s Waking Up with AI. I''m Katherine Forrest.  Scott Caravello: And I''m Scott Caravello. Katherine, episode 100 is behind us. How are we feeling?  Katherine Forrest: I''m feeling pretty good. I''m feeling like we got a little cadence going here, Scott.  Scott Caravello: I think that''s right; we''re getting there.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah. And so we''ve covered so much that I will tell our audience that it''s really worth looking back at some of the prior episodes, and there’s a couple of real, sort of, nuggets in there. I want to just remind our audience that we''ve got one on why it''s so important—episode number one, actually—was why it''s so important for a company to have a common definition of AI. We''ve got a number of different episodes that talk about what kinds of things you might want as an in-house lawyer to make sure your board understands. We''ve talked about, you know, vendor agreements and AI. We''ve talked about all kinds of new model releases and a lot of new research. And so... just, I encourage people to go back and to look over the prior episodes and maybe pick out a few that might be of interest to them that they may not have gotten before. And if anybody has listened to all 100, I want to send you some swag. We have got swag for the person, or persons, who come forward and say that they are, you know, true listeners to all 100 episodes.  Scott Caravello: And do they have to prove it? Do they have to, you know, show their Spotify queue, everything completed, or can we take people''s words for it?  Katherine Forrest: No, I''ll take their word for it. Like, I believe in, like, the honest person who''s just gonna say I''ve subjected themselves to 100 episodes. Like who wants to be in that crowd? I hope there''s somebody, you know, I really like this. But you know, we''ve got a couple of towels left over with Paul Weiss Waking Up With AI, right? We do.  Scott Caravello: Yeah. Yeah, those are great.  Katherine Forrest: The towels, we''ve got a couple of like Marmo and Patagonia jackets. We''ve got some, uh, mugs. So anyway… turning to today''s episode, you know, we''re going to be talking now about some developments in China.  Scott Caravello: Right, so we have mentioned the AI action plan and the White House''s focus on competition in the AI race with China. But we''re going to sort of go to the flip side of that, which is actually diving into how China is, itself, approaching AI.  Katherine Forrest: Right. And actually China approaching AGI and the race for AGI. So we''re not going to cover all of this in a single episode, but there really is an interesting report. You know, we like reports, that we''re going to encourage our readers to use. I tend to print them out, which is why I hold them up in front of the camera, but that nobody but you and I can see. And so the one that I''m holding up right now was released in December of 2025 by Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology, or CSET . Again, that''s Georgetown''s Center for Security and Emerging Technology with the acronym “C-SET.” And the report is called, “China''s Embodied AI: A Path to AGI.” And it''s really got a lot of information here that is very interesting about where... China is, the history of how it gets there. And, as you know, Scott, I''ve had a particular interest in embodied AI.  Scott Caravello: Yep. And I am excited for this one too, Katherine, because I have been following CSET and their China analysis for a while now. And I think we''ll get into an earlier report from them. I think that came out last May that''s on the topic and there''s just so much ground to cover here. So if it''s good with you, I will just go ahead and set the stage, but we''ll be coming back repeatedly to the view that some hold that embodied AI, which is AI in the physical world, and AGI are interconnected. And the CSET report indicates that this proposition has serious buy-in from the Chinese state. And as a result, that''s influencing the dynamics in the race to AGI.   Katherine Forrest: Yeah, you know, so first of all, I want to do two things. One, I want to mention the name of the report that you had just referenced, which was the May 2025 CSET report, also from the same Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology. And it''s called, “Wuhan''s AI Development: China''s Alternative Springboard to Artificial General Intelligence.” And that''s again, May 2025. So I wanna sort of make sure we have that. And then I wanna do something else, which is talk a little bit about the connection between embodiment and AGI. ’Cause you know, I''m a big fan of this and we''ve talked about Jan LeCun on a prior episode and world models and there''s a relationship here. So there is a theory within the AI research community that artificial general intelligence will take some form of embodiment to actually be fully realized. Why? Because AI otherwise is learning through words, through pictures, through different kinds of multimodal data, but it''s not learning necessarily the laws of physics as humans do through moving in the world. And so there''s a concept that embodied AI, which would be, let''s just say, all kinds of robotics, and there are lots and lots of different kinds of robotics. It''s not just humanoid robotics or quadruped robotics, and we did an episode on robotics, but it''s lots of different devices that move and experience the world in a real way. And the concept is that if you''ve got embodied AI that pushes over a... vase, which I call a vase and I don''t call it a voss . I just never have. Okay. I just want to say that. And it pushes over a vase and realizes that the vase, if it''s made out of a breakable material like ceramic or glass, is going to break. That that is then a learned moment. So rather than just hearing or reading or watching it on a movie that something breaks, sort of actually experiencing the physics of it is a different kind of experience that then gets brought into the information repository of whatever robotic embodiment that is and into the AI that is within that robotic embodiment. And there is a different kind of learned behavior. So, you know, we know that China is very interested in embodiment and there has been, you know, a fair amount of speculation about what they''re doing about it.  Scott Caravello: Right, and so then turning back to that first CSET report that we mentioned, and it explains that compared to the US''s very LLM-centric approach to AGI, China has made a broader bet, and that includes, but isn''t limited to, embodied AI. But the report is looking at embodied AI and looking at statements from researchers in China, along with measures and initiatives that are being taken at the national and local government levels, to show just how widely shared that view is, that embodied AI is a key potential path to explore on the road to AGI. So, I think, I do just want to sort of draw that out a bit more, which is just that it''s still one of a number of bets that China is placing on AGI, but it''s an important one that they''re taking seriously.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, and that''s one that actually, you know, some others, as we''d mentioned before, like Jan LeCun and some others are actually also thinking that there needs to be a kind of a way in which a world model gets embedded into AI in order for it to fully experience, through a world model, AGI. Now, one thing I do want to say, as a little aside, is that there are very, very likely many different ways to actually reach AGI. And when you reach AGI, there''s going to be a spectrum of where you are on that, sort of, road of AGI. The road could be a very long road, and you could be at the first point on that road where you could hit AGI and not be deeply into AGI. You might not be as far along as another AI model. So not all AI models may reach AGI at the same time, and they may not all reach it in the same way. So it''s possible that you don''t need embodiment for AGI. That''s one of the bets that many of the high capability LLM developers are making, although some of them also have various kinds of embodiments. We know that there are world models which now are emergent capabilities within even LLMs. So I don''t want to suggest through this discussion today that embodiment has to be the way to get to AGI. So let''s talk about, you know, the way in which the LLMs do it now.  Scott Caravello: Sure. So I can dive into that a little bit quickly, Katherine, which is just that language for LLMs is a depiction of the world and it''s a representation. And the idea that you scale it up and you increase the reasoning, the abstraction is going to help you get to AGI. And then for embodied AI, on the other hand, the idea is that human intelligence is a product of interaction between the brain, the body and the environment. And the physical element is a key component of our intelligence. And so the idea is that it''s therefore going to be a part of achieving artificial general intelligence that approximates our abilities. But, so, like you mentioned, Katherine, though, it''s not like LLMs, you know, have no role—that LLMs and world models need to be integrated into a physical component to get to AGI. But, again, that is just one school of thought.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, you know, it''s really it''s a philosophical debate and one of the things that I say in my forthcoming book on superintelligence…  Scott Caravello: There we go!  Katherine Forrest: … called, “Of Another Mind,” soon to be out for pre-order , uh, one of the things that I say is that, you know, we humans in different parts of the world and on our earth learn an awful lot about the way the world works in terms of physics. And in terms of, for instance, the way that, you know, gravity plays with waves to make the waves in our ocean and the waves in the air, that there are lots of things that we can learn about that we can''t see even. And so that''s one of the reasons why I, personally, think that embodiment is not necessarily the be all and the end all. But, in any event, moving back to the concept that CSET is talking about, because it''s very, very important. So, the CSET report tracks initiatives from various levels of the government of China—what''s clear is that China is taking this incredibly seriously. It''s taking embodiment and the relationship of embodiment to AGI very seriously. And one example in the CSET report is, at the municipal level, there''s a three-year plan from a Beijing administrative body to facilitate, you know, this particular technology''s development, but also that the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has identified embodied AI as a target for accelerated development. So there''s a lot of money, a lot of research going into this.  Scott Caravello: Right, and that target was set at the fourth plenum in October, which was focused on drafting the country''s 15th five-year plan. So as CSET notes, inclusion of embodied AI really signals its importance in central leadership in China.  Katherine Forrest: Right, and there are many others too, which we don''t have time to get into, but the report identifies the numerous research and innovation centers around China that are working on embodied AI and particularly forms of embodiment that would fall under what we would call the rubric of robotics. And it highlights how in higher education in China, embodiment has been embraced as part of AI technical development, and there are eight, now, top universities that have announced plans to offer a major in that.  Scott Caravello: Yeah, and, you know, that gives me another idea for an episode, Katherine—which is discussing how AI is being folded, more broadly, into higher education in the United States—because I’ve literally no idea if there are similar programs in the United States that are focused, you know, on sub-sectors of the technology .  Katherine Forrest: I am gonna write that down!  Scott Caravello: Ok—great, great. And, going back to the report, it underscores the breadth of the country’s approach—from industry to research to education to those government planning and initiatives—but, I think, with that, we can segway into the other CSET report that we had mentioned, which, again, is titled, “Wuhan’s AI Development: China’s Alternative Springboard to Artificial General Intelligence,” and, again, that’s from May 2025, but that describes a project taking place in Wuhan to roll out what’s called a large-scale social simulator , and infuse AI throughout the city, and that’s being done by bringing together the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Automation, Huawei, the technology company, and Peking University. And, so, according to CSET’s report, that social simulator will, “simulate multi-scale, physical-world, and social complex systems,” on the path to becoming the operating model of a co-existing smart society, and a tool for social governance.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, it''s interesting. I–you know, you have to, sort of, wonder what all that means and how it''s been going. So, while that initiative doesn''t seem to be about embodiment in a robotic sense, it is about infusing AI into a real environment throughout a city and learning, based upon interactions, how AI learns from that environment and how humans, actually, may interact and learn from the AI. So, it''s really, uh, if we can get more information on it as it''s gone through some sort of evolution and a timeline over there, it''ll be very interesting to look at.  Scott Caravello: Right, and, so, there is an AGI angle here, and, so, I don’t want to miss that, but the idea is that the rollout of this type of system, which is taking data from all over the city, will give AI opportunities to become more intelligent and, thereby, promote its evolution into AGI. The data that the platform is getting from the city is, you know, real data that’s grounded in the physical world. And, so, the idea of being that contrasts with the language we’re talking about, that’s a depiction of the physical world. And, so, this also just highlights what we were saying earlier… that the country is really diversifying its bets in pursuit of AGI.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, and, you know, one thing that''s worth touching on, which is really sort of an aside, but important, is that there have been reports at the end of 2025, in major U.S. established news outlets, that China has constructed the biggest power grid ever seen, generating twice as much electricity as the United States—at least in a certain area. And so this means, for instance, that China data centers could be supplied in different ways and their, of course, cost structure is always different from what we have in the United States.  Scott Caravello: Yeah, and they are anticipated to spend more than half a trillion on their grid over–over the next five years. And, then, in 2028, China’s expected to operationalize a nationally interconnected grid of data centers, which is, you know, referred to as a national cloud .  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, you know, this is what OpenAI in the past has called an electron advantage , that computing is simply cheaper and more widely available in China compared to the U.S. because our power grid is aging. And there''s been actually a lot of media coverage of that, you know, in the recent, uh, last couple of weeks.  Scott Caravello: And, so, Katherine, since you like how I summed it up so much last time… I’m gonna go for it again.  Katherine Forrest: Yeah, sum it up again! Take us home, Scott!  Scott Caravello: So, China’s placing bets on different approaches to AGI, including embodiment, and this large scale deployment of AI throughout society, and, just as in the United States, the infrastructure is an essential part of the story, too. And, China’s buildout of its power grid and data centers are a key piece of that puzzle.  Katherine Forrest: The data centers and power grids, energy, water, the resources, the rare earth minerals, these are all essential components that sometimes we lose sight of, but they are the core of the whole thing. So, that''s all we''ve got time for today. I''m Katherine Forrest.  Scott Caravello: And I’m Scott Caravello—don’t forget to like and subscribe.       View Full Transcript              {

How to manage a robotics club (VEX)
Hi for background information, I am the cofounder of my high-schools first Vex robotics club along with my partner whom is a junior. What we usually did back when it first started was admit anyone interested, and explained the guidelines for Vex robotics. My partner took attendance while I presented. It became an issue as newer people kept wanting to join.
Once the Vex kits came in, we assigned groups to build and get to know each other  fr During this time, there wasn’t really a need for slideshows, just person to person guidance.  I noticed that with around 20-25 kids it was difficult to manage them and unnecessary for 6+ people to work on one robot each. Around 16 people will join the competition that’s taking place in a month or two. Out of the 20+ people, 3 will manage the code.
Furthermore, now that the robots are built, I am finding it hard to plan forward. I’d love to hear about it how other people managed similar clubs. What my plan is, using robot kits we purchased online, I hope let them get building land controlling experiences.Als should I kick the people that rarely show up?

&Jakob Mökander Tony Blair Institute for Global Change Yale Digital Ethics Center    Abstract  The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI’s potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.     1 Introduction   Embodied AI (EAI) refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems and agents that are grounded in the physical world and learn through perception and action Paolo et al. ( 2024 ); Liu et al. ( 2024 ) . EAI systems can operate across diverse environments. For example, existing EAI applications can deliver packages Li et al. ( 2023 ) , patrol public spaces as security guards Qiongfang ( 2024 ) , or care for humans in intimate settings such as elder-care homes Takenaka ( 2025 ); Kim ( 2025 ) . EAI capabilities and domains are likely to expand significantly in the coming years Garlick et al. ( 2024 ); Suleyman and Bhaskar ( 2023 ) .    EAI presents both opportunities and risks for humans. EAI systems already assist people with mobility impairments in navigating the world (e.g., autonomous cars), while future systems could fill crucial agricultural or manufacturing jobs as working-age populations decline. By augmenting and complementing human labor, EAI could foster significant economic development and prosperity Atkinson ( 2021 ) . On the other hand, EAI systems can more easily cause immediate physical damage than completely virtual AI systems and may cause significant social harm as humans and EAI systems form closer connections (particularly with applications designed for companionship) Prescott and Robillard ( 2021 ); Oravec ( 2022 ) . See Figure 1 for a schematic comparison of classical robots, agentic AI, and EAI.    Recent breakthroughs in AI capabilities—particularly those related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)—have catalyzed unprecedented progress in EAI systems’ ability to navigate and act in the physical world Kim et al. ( 2024 ); Gemini Robotics Team et al. ( 2025 ) . At the same time, the rise of Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs)—which cast control as next-token prediction over interleaved visual and linguistic tokens—opens the possibility for a “ChatGPT moment” for robotics, with sharp jumps in capability, deployment, and public awareness. Recent debuts of models like Gemini Robotics-ER, Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-VL, and NVIDIA’s Isaac GR00T N1 marked significant EAI algorithmic progress, even though these models are only slowly being paired with hardware advanced enough to translate virtual capabilities into real-world actions Gemini Robotics Team et al. ( 2025 ); Bai et al. ( 2025 ); noa ( 2025a ) . In the past few months, for example, EAI systems have completed half-marathons and shown the ability to unpack groceries with little prior context Diviggiano and Baptista ( 2025 ); noa ( 2025b ) , and open-source resources from industry actors like Physical Intelligence and Unitree could spur continued technical progress noa ( 2025c ); uni .    Data acquisition—traditionally a bottleneck for EAI development due to the complexity and quantity of physical-world information needed to train models Goldberg ( 2025 ) —is partially being addressed through open-source datasets and cross-modality approaches Collaboration et al. ( 2025 ) . Simultaneously, innovations in tactile sensing, data-chunking radar, LiDAR, actuators, and power systems are expanding the potential form factors and capabilities of EAI systems Read ( 2024 ); Xi et al. ( 2024 ); Black et al. ( 2025 ) . Progress in physical abilities, data collection, and deployment may lower barriers to creating high-quality models about how the external world operates Amato et al. ( 2025 ) . These world models involve complex perception, planning, reasoning, and memory Fung et al. ( 2025 ) , and increasing EAI funding and research could lead to more accurate world models and positive EAI-development feedback loops. EAI research and innovation is also quickly emerging as a new frontier in geopolitical conflict, as concerns about supply chains and national industrial policy become more salient Patel et al. ( 2025 ); noa ( 2025d ) .    Figure 1: A comparison of classical robots, agentic AI, and EAI EAI represents the intersection of agentic AI and classical robots. Many existing robots, such as industrial machines (including articulated arms, gantry systems, and other types) lack the autonomy and reasoning capabilities that agentic AI possesses. Conversely, many agentic AI systems such as chatbots or virtual assistants currently lack physical embodiment.    EAI’s rapid growth in capabilities and deployment will increase the severity of potential harms and the urgency to address risks. This growth will necessitate significant updates to social, legal, and economic systems Suleyman and Bhaskar ( 2023 ); Floridi ( 2017 ) . Although EAI shares many characteristics with virtual agentic AI Floridi and Sanders ( 2004 ) , such as the varying degrees of autonomy and capability highlighted by Kasirzadeh et al. in “Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance,” Kasirzadeh and Gabriel ( 2025 ) , the physical embodiment of EAI systems introduces distinct considerations and risks that warrant special attention Xing et al. ( 2025 ) . EAI systems can hit, cut, bump, maim, attack, and more, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The complexity of the physical world presents significant adaptation challenges for digital models trained in virtual simulations Semeraro et al. ( 2023 ); Mazumder et al. ( 2023 ) . The coming wave of technological breakthroughs may also usher in a new era of scalability in which EAI will rapidly advance through an ever-improving software stack constrained by fewer human bottlenecks, thereby increasing the potential speed of change and compressing the timeline for action Wu et al. ( 2025 ) .    Before rushing to policy action, it is essential to note that EAI is not a new concept but rather an evolution of traditional robotics. The EAI field builds upon decades of science fiction imagination, human-robot interaction research, and forecasting about advanced robotics Asimov ( 1977 ); Barfield et al. ( 2024 ); Akalin et al. ( 2023 ) . In fact, the term “embodied AI” itself is partly a marketing technique used to differentiate recent innovations from traditional robotics.    Safety concerns about EAI are likewise not novel, as researchers have studied safety in robotics for decades Zhou et al. ( 1998 ); Aström and Wittenmark ( 1995 ) . Tools to formally verify robot behavior have included model predictive control Mayne et al. ( 2000 ) , control barrier functions Ames et al. ( 2017 ) , and temporal logic Kloetzer and Belta ( 2008 ) , among other key innovations. Many seminal papers focusing on safe AI design prominently feature imaginary robots as examples of safe human-AI collaboration Amodei et al. ( 2016 ); Hadfield-Menell et al. ( 2016 ) . More recent work has focused on creating safety guardrails for robots from real-world data, such as in Sermanet et al.’s “Generating Robot Constitutions and Benchmarks for Semantic Safety.” Sermanet et al. ( 2025 ) However, beyond a recent UN resolution initiating discussions on lethal autonomous weapons noa ( 2024a ) , there remains an alarming policy vacuum regarding EAI safety at national and international levels.    Understanding and minimizing risks from EAI will become even more critical in a world with AI capabilities equivalent to or surpassing artificial general intelligence (AGI), however defined Vermeer et al. ( 2025 ) . For example, increased AI-generated cyberattack capabilities could lead to perpetual attack-defense cycles, where EAI systems become targets for exploitation Shah et al. ( 2025 ) . The precise impact of AGI-level capabilities on EAI development remains uncertain, potentially accelerating deployment while simultaneously enabling more robust safety measures. AGI uncertainties aside, EAI risks are critically understudied and poorly understood, and current regulatory frameworks are generally insufficient to guide safe EAI development.    This paper clarifies the risks and governance challenges posed by EAI and suggests a pragmatic sociotechnical approach to help governments and researchers support the development of safe EAI Watson et al. ( 2024 ) . This paper makes three unique contributions to address this urgent issue:      1.   We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of risks from EAI, spanning physical, informational, economic, and social dimensions. This taxonomy of existing, emerging, and projected risks covers concerns ranging from malicious physical harm from jailbreaking LLMs and privacy violations in homes to widespread labor displacement. To create this taxonomy, we draw on the extensive literature related to robot safety, human-robot interaction, and recent predictions about AI’s trajectory.     2.   We analyze existing policy frameworks related to EAI to assess their adequacy and highlight critical coverage gaps. Although specific pieces of legislation governing autonomous vehicles or advanced robotics trend in the right direction, significant and concerning gaps remain in existing frameworks. For example, current regulations concerning robots are ill-suited to govern systems that have high levels of autonomy and continuous learning; these characteristics challenge existing safety testing and assurance paradigms.     3.   With these risks and gaps in mind, we propose and discuss several targeted policy interventions to improve EAI safety. We suggest increasing targeted safety research, establishing robust certification requirements for EAI, promoting industry-led standards (which can offer clarity until slower-moving legislation and international agreements are passed), clarifying liability regimes, and creating substantive and actionable policy blueprints to respond to transformative economic and social effects of EAI.       This paper has several key limitations. Given EAI’s expansive and cross-cutting nature, we made practical choices to limit the scope of this paper. We primarily address civilian applications of EAI, although military and law enforcement applications also deserve special consideration. We focus on frameworks from the US, UK, and EU, though emerging regulatory efforts in other regions—especially in China—deserve increased attention and analysis. We also recognize that ensuring safe embodied AI will require a multi-layered approach, with mechanisms to enhance safety at the model, application, and organizational layers Mökander et al. ( 2024 ) . While it remains crucial to ensure the safety of underlying models through growing AI safety research, we focus on strengthening safety measures for EAI-specific applications and organizational deployments. We likewise acknowledge that many risks from EAI are extensions of risks from powerful virtual or non-embodied AI systems. However, EAI also presents unique risks that arise at the intersection of the virtual and physical worlds. Acknowledging this context, we aim to provide a solid foundation upon which future work can build.    In the coming years, policymakers may quickly become aware of the risks posed by EAI because of headline-grabbing breakthroughs or threats from EAI. This could rapidly elevate EAI regulation on policy agendas, so policymakers must be equipped with appropriate tools and contextual understanding to create clear and beneficial legislation. Already, the overlap between the EU’s AI Act and Machinery Regulations, which target robots, creates confusing and tangled requirements. Further policy action without regard for existing frameworks could impede, rather than improve, EAI safety. To ensure the safe and beneficial development of this transformative technology, we argue that policymakers must urgently build upon and address gaps in existing frameworks for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and agentic AI.      2 Taxonomy of Risks from EAI   Drawing on existing research and current predictions about EAI trajectories, we identify and explore four crucial areas of EAI risks: physical, informational, economic, and social (see Figure 2). This taxonomy leads to our discussion of how existing policy frameworks address—or fail to address—these EAI risks.     2.1 Physical risks   Purposeful or malicious harm   EAI systems present distinct physical risks due to their embodiment in the physical world. EAI technologies have already been designed and deployed with lethal intent, such as AI-controlled drones Schmitt and Savage ( 2023 ); Bondar ( 2025 ) . However, fully autonomous military robots, often integrated with bespoke AI architectures Demarest ( 2025 ); Hambling ( 2024 ) , are not yet widely used in combat. While highly or fully autonomous warfare is distinctly possible in the future Cummings ( 2017 ) , immediate risks arise from commercially available EAI systems, including AI-controlled quadrupeds and autonomous driving assistants. Recent research has demonstrated that these systems inherit jailbreaking vulnerabilities from LLM-based AI models Zou et al. ( 2023 ); Chao et al. ( 2023 , 2024 ); Robey et al. ( 2023 ) . This could allow malicious actors to subvert safety guardrails and perform a range of harmful and irreversible physical tasks, including detonating explosives and deliberately causing human collisions Robey et al. ( 2025 ); Zhang et al. ( 2024 ); Ravichandran et al. ( 2025 ) . VLAs exacerbate this risk: an attacker might craft a visual scene or textual instruction that, when interpreted through a language-action policy, yields physically dangerous instructions not anticipated by vision- or language-only defenses Jones et al. ( 2025 ); Wang et al. ( 2024 ) .    Figure 2: An illustrated summary of risks from embodied AI . We identify four key risk categories and provide several existing or potential mechanisms through which EAI systems could cause harm within each risk area.     Accidental harm   Automation in sectors ranging from manufacturing to healthcare has and will increasingly put humans into close contact with EAI systems Garlick et al. ( 2024 ) . This interaction increases the risk of accidental physical harm. Though accidental harm has been a longstanding issue in industrial robotics, increased AI capabilities could exacerbate this risk; several recent reports document an increase in industrial injuries following the introduction of AI-controlled robots Atkinson ( 2023 ); Fortune Staff ( 2023 ); Youn ( 2018 ) . Virtual AI applications can also cause harm (e.g. through misinterpreted goals or misaligned behavior) but not directly in the physical world, unlike EAI. EAI’s potential to cause accidental, physical harm could be caused by misspecified goals, lack of semantic understanding, misaligned behavior, physical hardware malfunctions, or other unanticipated behaviors Amodei et al. ( 2016 ); Ji et al. ( 2025 ); Matheson et al. ( 2019 ) . For example, a humanoid EAI might not correctly reason that placing a full glass of milk on a tilted table is perilous and likely to lead to a dangerous broken glass Fry , or a swarm of EAI systems might get caught in a physical logjam and run over humans by mistake while trying to unstick themselves Winfield et al. ( 2025 ) . Researchers also face persistent difficulty in getting models trained in purely virtual simulations to act as intended in the real physical world—what is referred to as the “reality gap.” Bousmalis et al. ( 2018 ) . This introduces significant scope for accidental physical harm if the deployed world does not closely match an EAI’s training data Kaushik et al. ( 2022 ) .       2.2 Informational risks   Privacy violations   EAI systems interact with huge amounts of data, creating significant privacy concerns. These systems are often trained on vast corpora and process a variety of data modalities—spanning visual, auditory, and tactile information—during deployment Kim et al. ( 2024 ) . Like text-based virtual AI models, which are known to memorize and expose personally identifiable information Nasr et al. ( 2023 ); Carlini et al. ( 2019 ) , commercial robots have been shown to disclose proprietary information through simple prompts Robey et al. ( 2025 ) . Whereas virtual AI systems are constrained to collect data from either virtual interfaces or fixed points in the physical world (e.g. security cameras collecting facial-recognition data), EAI’s mobility and the vast array of sensors used in EAI technologies expand concerns about unauthorized data collection. For example, EAI systems can monitor user behavior, infer physical preferences, and potentially contribute to future model training without the informed consent of those being observed beyond the limitations of immobile microphones or security cameras Calo ( 2011 ); Chatzimichali et al. ( 2020 ); Guo ( 2022 ) . Bad actors within governments or corporations could gain access to private data streams and monitor users’ movements 24/7, providing significant leverage over individuals to squash dissent or achieve personal power Davidson et al. ( 2025 ) .     Misinformation   Non-embodied AIs are known to propagate misinformation Chen and Shu ( 2024 ); Pan et al. ( 2023 ) . Various studies have shown that LLMs hallucinate information, including academic citations Agrawal et al. ( 2023 ) , clinical knowledge Singhal et al. ( 2023 ) , and cultural references Weng ( 2024 ) . EAI systems inherit these shortcomings in the physical world, answering user questions with deceptive or incorrect information Danaher ( 2020 ) . Because VLAs fuse vision and language, their hallucinatory failures can be spatially grounded—e.g., misidentifying an object in view and then generating a plausible yet unsafe action plan around it. And although automated home assistants like Amazon’s Alexa already lie about issues as innocuous as Santa Claus’ existence Withers ( 2018 ) , more mobile, capable, and trusted EAI systems in sensitive positions (like home-assistant or community-service positions) could easily spread model developers’ propaganda and talking points to users. For example, an EAI running on DeepSeek’s latest model could provide a subtle yet continuous stream of misinformation to American users while performing tasks as innocuous as folding laundry or helping to cook dinner Myers ( 2025 ); Lin ( 2024 ) .       2.3 Economic risks   Labor displacement   While virtual AI applications will likely displace certain types of human cognitive labor, EAI systems could significantly replace or displace physical human labor Du et al. ( 2024 ) . At a minimum, EAI will likely augment the type of work that humans perform Acemoglu and Autor ( 2011 ); Loaiza and Rigobon ( 2024 ) . Classical industrial robots have taken over many human roles in manufacturing Grau et al. ( 2021 ) , and research has shown that robot deployment can lead to a reduction in human employment Acemoglu and Restrepo ( 2020 ) . Future technological advances will likely accelerate this displacement process, as increasingly capable EAI systems perform complex, multi-step physical tasks beyond assembly lines—for instance, by serving as tourist guides or teaching in classrooms, and all without the need for sleep, breaks, sick leave, or vacation Newton and Newton ( 2019 ) . Though automation has historically redirected labor toward areas of human comparative advantage Acemoglu and Restrepo ( 2019 ) , AGI-enabled EAI could potentially automate all physical labor Korinek and Juelfs ( 2023 ) .     Socioeconomic inequality   Along with displacing labor, EAI could significantly exacerbate wealth inequalities. Those who have access to or own EAI systems will be able to automate labor and perform many tasks significantly better or faster than those without access. These significant productivity advantages will potentially concentrate wealth and exacerbate domestic and international inequality Costinot and Werning ( 2018 ); Korinek and Stiglitz ( 2017 ) . For example, while a wealthy businesswoman could invest in a fleet of the latest humanoid robots, individuals lacking adequate capital might be forced to rent their EAI systems. This division could create stark and entrenched socioeconomic divides as the importance of outsourcing labor to ever-more-capable EAI increases Freeman ( 2016 ) . Virtual AI applications may cause similar socioeconomic inequality, but the ability to use and control access to EAI systems may confer significant and unique returns on investment, given that many tasks in the physical world necessary for human survival (e.g. growing food, building shelter) are constrained by human strength and energy.     Power concentration   EAI deployment could accelerate the consolidation of economic and political power. Unlocking increasing returns to capital for EAI owners, EAI will decrease employers’ reliance on and responsiveness to the needs of human labor Kulveit et al. ( 2025 ) . Further, EAI users or consumers may become dependent on EAI owners for goods and services due to the productivity advantages conferred by EAI systems Berg et al. ( 2018 ); Ford ( 2016 ) . The importance of EAI to perform physical tasks will likely exacerbate power-concentration risks presented by purely virtual AI systems. The proliferation of EAI systems could thus lead to a rapid concentration of corporate economic (and social) power, potentially even facilitating an eventual coup involving EAI Widder et al. ( 2024 ); Davidson et al. ( 2025 ) .       2.4 Social risks   Bias and discrimination   Like virtual applications of AI, EAI can display bias towards and discriminate against users. When EAI systems are placed in positions of power, their biases could have significant impacts on fairness in everyday interactions and on general social dynamics Howard and Borenstein ( 2018 ); Londoño et al. ( 2024 ) . For example, a peacekeeping humanoid robot may discriminate based on skin color Azeem et al. ( 2024 ) . Unlike virtual AI applications, this bias can have immediate and irreversible physical consequences (e.g. if the peacekeeping robot mistakenly injures an innocent passerby).     Lack of accountability and liability   Determining responsibility when EAI causes harm requires new accountability and liability frameworks that address the complexities of highly autonomous physical systems. Human users may disagree with decisions taken by expert EAI systems, raising significant questions of delegation and responsibility Millar and Kerr ( 2016 ) . Lack of EAI accountability could lead to confusion for users and breakdowns in traditional justice systems Rachum-Twaig ( 2020 ) . For example, we may soon need to consider who to blame and how to collect damages when a highly autonomous robotic surgeon removes a healthy organ by mistake Guerra et al. ( 2024 ) . Although virtual AI applications also raise liability concerns, EAI’s ability to cause physical damage underscores the importance of establishing robust liability regimes, as liability is crucial in remedying physical harms.     Lack of transparency, explainability, and trust   Understanding how AI reaches conclusions or why AI systems perform specific actions motivates an entire branch of interpretability research Olah et al. ( 2018 ) , but physical embodiment raises the stakes for understanding these systems. For example, transparency of planned actions and explainability of decision-making is crucial when an AV suddenly changes lanes. A lack of transparency and explainability could lead to a lack of trust, which could become a critical and socially destabilizing issue with the widespread deployment of EAI Kok and Soh ( 2020 ); Hancock et al. ( 2011 ); Esterwood and Jr ( 2023 ) .     Unhealthy or dangerous human-EAI relationships   Constant access to and interaction with EAI systems could foster dangerous human dependence or romantic attachment Rabb et al. ( 2022 ) . People may depend on EAI systems for physical pleasure Cox-George and Bewley ( 2018 ) . The physical presence and human-like features of EAI systems may significantly amplify the dependency issues already observed with conversational AI Fang et al. ( 2025 ); Freedman ( 2025 ) . People may easily fall in love with EAI systems, only to be distraught when these systems are altered or have their memories reset Jonze ( 2013 ) .     Transformative effects   EAI deployment could fundamentally reshape society, particularly if the speed of technological development outpaces society’s ability to adapt Ford ( 2016 ); Brynjolfsson and McAfee ( 2014 ) . For example, EAI systems could provide physical threats of violence and mass surveillance capabilities to back up AI-enabled authoritarianism Barez et al. ( 2025 ) . Businesses might only employ EAI systems, leaving humans free to engage in other activities but also affecting how humans find meaning in their work Nikolova et al. ( 2024 ) . Humans also might lose the ability to perform various tasks as responsibilities are increasingly outsourced or delegated to EAI systems Kulveit et al. ( 2025 ) —as an existing example, humans can lose natural abilities to navigate their environment when they outsource navigation to automated GPS systems Dahmani and Bohbot ( 2020 ) . Of course, purely virtual AI may also transform human society (and, to some extent, already has). However, it is difficult to comprehend how profoundly and completely EAI could alter how humans work, socialize, and structure our societies—for example by revolutionizing physical labor norms, automating self-improvement and production, or becoming humans’ primary social and physical companions Boyd and Holton ( 2018 ) .        3 Heat map of relevant policies   Existing policy frameworks already address many risks identified in Section 2. Understanding how current regulations apply—or fail to apply—to EAI systems is essential for both policymakers and researchers. This section examines key legislation from the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU) that governs related technologies, including classical robotics, autonomous vehicles, and virtual agentic AI. Our analysis identifies regulatory gaps specific to EAI by examining where existing frameworks provide minimal, adequate, or substantial policy coverage. This review, while not exhaustive, focuses on civilian applications of EAI.    Table 1: A summary of coverage of policies for major EAI risks. We examine whether existing policies or governance frameworks exist to address risks from technologies related to EAI. ● \CIRCLE indicates that there is already a high level of coverage of relevant policies; ◑ \RIGHTcircle indicates there is partial coverage but that significant adjustments are likely necessary; ○ \Circle indicates a significant lack of governance frameworks to address the relevant risk.

This section first addresses several policy frameworks that govern physical harms, focusing on laws and standards that apply to AVs and robots given the lack of existing rulemaking for virtual agents. It then examines the major pieces of legislation that address informational harms. This section provides a brief overview of policies that address economic and social EAI harms given the limited existing policies in this area.    Physical risks   Emerging approaches to governing physical risks from EAI primarily target AVs and drones. AV-specific laws usually follow one of two approaches: adapting conventional automobile laws or creating bespoke legislation Geistfeld ( 2017 ); Kubica ( 2022 ) . For example, the UK’s Automated Vehicles Act 2024 introduced the concept of the Authorized Self-Driving Entity (ASDE) and the No-User-in-Charge (NUiC) operator. These entities (typically manufacturers or fleet operators) assume legal liability when the vehicle is in self-driving mode, effectively standing in for the “driver” noa ( 2024b ) . These ASDE and NUiC entities serve as helpful precedents for other forms of highly autonomous EAI; however, these roles were likely easier to introduce given continuity from other automotive regulatory efforts. Different forms of EAI—such as home care or educational EAI—will not have the same pre-existing foundation.    Instead of creating AV-specific legislation, many EU countries largely govern AVs using existing product liability paradigms that hold manufacturers accountable when systems cause harm while operating within intended parameters (i.e. the operational design domain). However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to autonomous systems. For example, German liability law states that humans are still considered drivers when operating an AV with SAE International Level 3 autonomy, in which humans must take over the operation of the vehicle when the system requests it but otherwise do not manipulate the vehicle. In SAE Level 4 vehicles, which require minimal human input, an owner-like entity, referred to as a “keeper” of a vehicle is instead held strictly liable for injuries Von Bodungen and Steege ( 2024 ) . This reliance on existing product liability law could help govern some forms of EAI, but directly charging the “keeper” of a model in the event of loss of life seems to overlook the complex web of relationships between the original manufacturer, software updater, operator, and owner. Stringent reliance on product liability law could also deter beneficial EAI development and deployment; manufacturers might be reluctant to risk exposure to judicial uncertainty as courts attempt to reconcile existing laws with increasingly intelligent and autonomous systems.    In the United States, the recently proposed ADS-equipped Vehicle Safety, Transparency, and Evaluation Program (AV STEP) would require approved AV manufacturers to share details about their vehicles’ development and operation. This would include information about the types of simulations used to train the vehicles’ algorithms, what sorts of environments the vehicle is meant to operate within, and relevant vehicle oversight mechanisms to ensure operational safety noa ( 2024c ) . AV STEP is a promising framework that could be extended to other EAI contexts, though it remains unclear which regulatory body would oversee other modalities of EAI. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Risk Management Framework could provide a helpful starting point for a sweeping, interagency approach to physical safety certification Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative ( 2018 ) .    Laws concerning aerial drones are also relevant to EAI policy, although many of today’s drones do not involve AI and operate with limited autonomy Nawaz ( 2024 ) . For example, EU regulation on drones distinguishes between remotely-piloted drones, autonomous drones—which can navigate dynamically without pilot intervention—and automatic drones that instead fly pre-planned routes EU_ ( 2019 ) . The EU requires that all drones are operated by a remote pilot who assumes responsibility for each flight. Pilots of autonomous and other high-risk drones must pass theoretical-knowledge and practical-skill courses. However, National Aviation Authorities often rely on self-declarations from pilots that their operations pose minimal threats to nearby people, for example by not flying over groups of people “uninvolved” in the drone’s operation. Non-autonomous drones require less stringent training to operate but face substantial operating restrictions; for example, pilots of these drones must maintain the drone in their line of sight at all times.    The UK’s regulation largely mirrors the EU’s drone rules, including a mandate that a drone be able to safely return to the ground in the event of a system failure or loss of communication noa ( 2025e ) . The drone regulation environment in the US is quickly evolving due to a June 2025 Executive Order that, among other changes, will make it easier for drones to operate beyond pilots’ line of sight for commercial and public-safety operations unl ( 2025 ) . The US federal government requires that all drones are equipped with remote-identification capabilities and must be able to broadcast the drone’s identity, location, altitude, and more Par ( 2021 ) . The UK will implement similar tracking requirements in 2026 CAA ( 2025 ) .    Another key piece of legislation is the EU’s Machinery Regulation (MR), which was passed in 2023 noa ( 2023 ) . Updating similar legislation from 2006, the MR regulates many types of robots in the EU and explicitly addresses aspects of AI and EAI safety. Tobias Mahler thoroughly investigates how the MR interacts and overlaps with the EU’s AI Act Mahler ( 2024 ) , identifying the MR’s attempt to future-proof its regulations through mentions of machines with “self-evolving behaviour…designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy.” The MR encompasses a comprehensive spectrum of physical safety concerns, ranging from the materials used to emergency-stopping systems to the risk of being trapped inside a machine. The MR mandates that machines sold in the EU must be tested for compliance with these safety regulations; as with other EU regulations, third-party evaluators (or “notified bodies”) test whether machines fulfill the safety requirements.    Beyond legislation, international standards provide manufacturers and deployers with robust safety guidance for robotics, primarily focused on physical safety. For example, ISO 10218:2025 recommends safety protocols for assessing risk, mitigating risk (e.g. through controls, safety functions, stopping functions), and safe-design certification for industrial robots noa ( 2025f ) . In addition, ISO 13482:2025 addresses safety requirements for service robots in personal and professional settings, emphasizing sensor reliability, uncertainty management protocols, and decision verification through multiple sensing modalities noa ( 2025g ) . Many standards also exist explicitly for AVs. For example, ISO/SAE 21434:2021 and UN Regulation 155 provide standards for cybersecurity engineering for road vehicles noa ( 2021a , b ) . These cybersecurity standards are particularly relevant for many forms of mobile EAI, especially given that EAI systems may be deployed in situations without regular access to trusted networks Thakker et al. ( 2025 ) (e.g. during disaster rescue missions, or when operating with law enforcement in hostile territory).     Informational risks   Many informational risks apply to both virtual and embodied AI applications. Key frameworks governing EAI informational risks include the EU’s AI Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This legislation prohibits several data practices relevant to EAI, such as untargeted facial image scraping and manipulative decision-influencing techniques noa ( 2024d ) . These restrictions are crucial for EAI systems that continuously collect data in public and private settings Mintrom et al. ( 2022 ) .    GDPR legislation in the EU and UK establishes strict governance requirements concerning the capture, use, and storage of data. GDPR requires that data is only collected for “legitimate interests” and that entities collecting data are classified as “data controllers” who must document data collection practices, usage patterns, and storage methods while implementing robust security measures GDP ( 2016 ) . These stipulations address many concerns with the privacy and treatment of data collected by EAI systems. However, EAI deployments in public spaces challenge traditional consent models and controller identification Mintrom et al. ( 2022 ) . Notions of data controllers and implied consent to be recorded will need to be substantially altered or clarified with EAI deployment. EAI systems deployed in public spaces, for example, raise questions about how to opt out of data collection, understand who receives and controls data collected from the system’s sensors, and even what constitutes a public vs. private space bar ( 2024 ) .     Economic risks   Regulatory frameworks addressing the economic impact of EAI remain underdeveloped. Existing legislation, such as the UK’s Employment Rights Act 1996 and the US WARN Act, provides limited protections for workers facing technological displacement noa ( 1996 , 1988 ) . Labor organizations have achieved isolated victories against automation, exemplified by the International Longshoreman Association’s recent successful challenge to port automation Berger ( 2025 ) . Policymakers must better prepare for widespread labor displacement resulting from the deployment of EAI in industrial and service settings. In reordering and reimagining labor structures, EAI innovation could lead to a period of rapid creative economic destruction Schumpeter ( 2008 ) .    Some observers think AI development represents a different kind of technological transition compared to previous transformations, as AI may replace cognitive tasks in addition to physical labor Suleyman and Bhaskar ( 2023 ); Cheng ( 2025 ) . Economic policies may not need to target technological failures, as with many physical and informational risks mentioned in Section 2. Economic risks may instead emerge because EAI systems work too well and rapidly upend the need for human labor. As a result, policymakers should consider social policies to manage these emerging tensions Mökander and Schroeder ( 2024 ) .     Social risks   Few regulations directly address the social impacts of EAI. Those that do exist largely govern issues of direct human interaction with EAI systems and do not address larger issues of how society will transform as these entities become increasingly prevalent and powerful. The EU AI Act’s broad prohibition on infringing fundamental rights could be extended to address issues surrounding a lack of trust, lack of transparency, unhealthy or dangerous attachments, and bias and discrimination, but this would require further specification. In terms of accountability, proposed frameworks for attributing actions and delegating authority to virtual agents could prove helpful for EAI Chan et al. ( 2025 ); South et al. ( 2025 ) .    GDPR Article 22 provides an instructive example of existing regulation that implicates but does not directly address EAI systems. Likely designed with virtual AI applications in mind, the Article prohibits individuals from being “subject to a decision based solely on automated processing” when that decision has legal or similarly significant consequences for that individual GDP ( 2016 ) . However, it remains unclear how this Article could be reconciled with fully autonomous EAI, or how individuals could appeal to a human intervener—as the Article later mandates—in immediate physical interactions or conflicts with EAI systems.    Beyond legislation, several international standards aimed at manufacturers and developers emphasize transparency, ethical design, and trustworthiness in EAI systems. However, these standards, including the IEEE’s 7000 series on autonomous system transparency IEE ( 2022 ) , algorithmic bias Koene et al. ( 2018 ) , and the impact of robotics on human well-being Schiff et al. ( 2020 ) , are voluntary. These standards could apply to a wide variety of EAI instantiations or applications, but their voluntary nature would similarly limit their impact.       3.2 What are the most significant gaps?   Though major building blocks to address harm from EAI systems already exist, several key policy gaps concerning EAI safety require urgent attention.    First, there are significant gaps concerning robust certification processes for different EAI modalities. Regulating AVs is straightforward in many senses due to their defined operational domains (e.g. cars usually stay on roads). The EU’s MR mandates certification of safety for a broader array of EAI modalities (with carve-outs for AVs or aerial drones) and stipulates that EAI “shall not…perform actions beyond its defined task and movement space.” Current drone regulations address many aspects of aerial drones, but this regulation largely focuses on drones lacking true autonomous navigation capabilities. Future instantiations of EAI, however, will likely have significantly expanded freedom of movement, enabling them to enter private residences and commercial establishments and conduct surveillance in schools or public areas. These expanded domains require thoughtful processes to certify the operational safety of EAI systems—such frameworks do not yet exist. Expecting existing consumer-safety laboratories, which currently test the safety of machine components like materials and locking mechanisms, to evaluate the safety of EAI sytems is unrealistic. Basic questions such as identifying the relevant regulator are a key starting point—to what extent should there be EAI-specific consumer protection boards with AI expertise, or should existing third-party testing laboratories take on this responsibility?    Secondly, once a suitable apparatus is in place, EAI capabilities should be measured with reliable and valid evaluations and benchmarks. To date, few of these benchmarks exist Sermanet et al. ( 2025 ) , despite the existence of a range of benchmarks for virtual AI systems noa ( 2024e ) . Voluntary standards can provide technical guidance, but the lack of laws enforcing benchmarking and evaluations across all four key risk areas (physical, informational, economic, and social) is a critical policy gap. Evaluations could cover a range of considerations outlined in our taxonomy, for example evaluating the robustness of simulation-to-real protocols (the “reality gap”), the conformity of EAI systems with their stated operational domain, robustness to jailbreaking, cybersecurity measures, alignment between software and hardware capabilities, and hardware durability and reliability, among other areas.    Thirdly, policies or frameworks currently devoted to post-deployment EAI monitoring are unclear or lacking in detail. These sorts of oversight and monitoring mechanisms have been highlighted for other AI systems Dunlop and Stein ( 2024 ) . However, current regulations requiring EAI systems to include “black boxes” that record and preserve data in the event of accidents, crashes, or misuse are hazy. The EU’s MR mandates that data about safety-related decision-making processes is kept for a year after its collection noa ( 2023 ) . At the same time, the EU’s AI Act provides contradictory guidance that high-risk AI systems must retain this information for at least six months noa ( 2024d ) . These types of recording systems, in addition to live data monitoring, can enhance system safety and aid post-incident investigations Kukkala et al. ( 2022 ); Mathew et al. ( 2025 ) . The EU’s MR also states that “it shall be possible at all times to correct the machinery…to maintain its inherent safety,” but this notion of oversight requires significant clarification for highly- or fully-autonomous systems. Does this involve the ability to tweak EAI actions in real-time, send new model updates over the air, or some other intervention? Who is conducting this monitoring—users, the government, or a private, delegated oversight entity (perhaps AI-driven itself)?    There are likewise stark gaps in policies addressing economic and social risks from EAI. Although EAI could cause mass labor displacement, proposals to distribute economic benefits are still in their infancy Yelizarova ( 2025 ); Merola ( 2022 ) . EAI could lead to many positive economic and social outcomes as well, but policymakers must then ensure that economies around the world have the sovereign systems (data centers, energy production, EAI hardware) necessary to seize EAI’s benefits. No well-articulated policy on this, whether national or regional, yet exists. Similarly, policies addressing social issues related to trust and human-EAI attachment are currently scant Bao et al. ( 2023 ) . More broadly, there are significant policy gaps at the intersection of EAI and AGI. For example, should an EAI system be allowed to build other EAI systems? Should a country developing AGI in embodied form automatically and freely share the technology with the rest of the world? There has likewise been little policy attention devoted to EAI defensive acceleration. If AGI is as powerful as some observers imagine, it seems possible or even plausible that AGI could help solve a raft of open governance questions and issues, particularly in the defense arena Clifford ( 2024 ) . Yet what does it mean for a society to be protected by an army of EAI systems? Policymakers must urgently consider how EAI should be developed, deployed, and integrated into societal structures to address the broad array of currently neglected challenges mentioned here.       4 Proposed pathways forward   To effectively mitigate these urgent EAI risks, ensure beneficial EAI development, and create a balanced regulatory environment, policymakers must fill gaps in today’s fragmented policy landscape with pragmatic approaches that adapt to the complexity of emerging EAI technology.     4.1 Invest in EAI safety research   Based on the risk taxonomy described in Section 2, we recommend significant and increased research be devoted to EAI safety. For example, robotics and machine-learning researchers can further efforts to make hardware actuators less susceptible to hacking and malfunction through physical design and formal methods Basin ( 2021 ) . Building benchmarks and evaluations of EAI capabilities and behavior is a particularly promising area of EAI safety research. Most AI benchmarks and evaluations today specifically target the virtual aspects of AI Grey and Segerie ( 2025 ) , although recent progress has been made in EAI-specific research, such as at Google DeepMind Sermanet et al. ( 2025 ) . Researchers should and build on this progress by developing EAI evaluations and benchmarks that span a broad set of tasks and task types Yin et al. ( 2025 ); Choi et al.

AI变身“智能伙伴”，中国迎来智能经济新时代
2025-12-16 08:47:05
来源：人民邮电报
当人工智能从“聪明工具”成长为能自主规划任务的“智能伙伴”，一场深刻的生产力革命正在你我身边悄然发生。12月13日，在“2026中国信通院深度观察报告会”现场，专家学者描绘的不仅是一幅AI的技术路线图，更是智能经济重构生产力与生产关系的全新图景。
万亿规模　AI成为经济发展新引擎
“人工智能正从工具升级为伙伴，全面赋能高质量发展。”中国信通院人工智能研究所所长魏凯的开场白，奠定了本次观察的基调。一组数据印证了这一判断：2024年我国人工智能核心产业规模突破9000亿元，增速达24％；2025年有望跨越1.2万亿元大关。这不仅是量的增长，更是质的跃升。
在技术层面，大模型正经历着能力的“爆发期”。魏凯指出：“从信通院的测试数据看，模型在语言和多模态理解能力上分别提升了30％和50％，推理、编程等能力实现了‘又好又快’的发展。”线性注意力机制、面向环境的强化学习等底层创新，正在为大模型的实用化铺平道路。
然而，更值得关注的是应用生态的结构性变化。智能体作为大模型落地的主要载体，已展现出“数字劳动力”的雏形。通用智能体在网页交互、信息整合等场景表现抢眼，专用智能体则在法律、编程等垂直领域精准破局。但魏凯也清醒地指出：“无论是专用还是通用，智能体还处在发展初期，任务规划的可靠性、与业务系统对接的复杂性等难题依然突出。”
全新突破　机器人从实验室走向现实
如果大模型是AI的“大脑”，那么具身智能就是为AI装上“身体”。中国信通院副总工程师许志远表示：“当前具身智能已取得认知智能与物理智能的双线突破。”
一方面，大模型让机器人具备了“可感知、可思考、可交互”的智能特征；另一方面，强化学习等技术让人形机器人在复杂地形行走、精细操作等物理能力上快速进步。然而许志远强调：“尽管技术突破不断，大规模落地仍处于早期。”
这一判断背后其实是三大核心路线之争。一是模型路线之争：大模型范式能否直接迁移到机器人控制？二是数据范式之争：真机数据、仿真数据、人类视频数据，哪类才是关键？三是形态路线之争：是全人形的路线还是“轮—臂式”的折中方案？
许志远表示：“国内今年涌现出多款‘轮—臂式复合机器人’，更强调工程可落地性。”这种务实路线与特斯拉等企业坚持的“通用人形机器人”愿景形成有趣对比，反映了中美AI产业不同发展阶段的不同优先级。
三“双”特征　智能经济重构经济形态
技术突破最终要服务于经济发展。中国信通院政策与经济研究所副所长孙克提出了一个更具宏观视野的概念：“智能经济是以人工智能技术为驱动力，形成全要素生产率大幅提升的新型经济形态。”在他看来，智能经济有三大特点：一是技术与应用相互促进。AI帮助企业提升效率，企业数据又让AI变得更聪明。二是既有传统产业升级，也有全新AI产品涌现。比如AI眼镜、智能手表等新品销量快速增长。三是人机协作成为常态。孙克特别指出：“现在‘一个人+AI’就能组成高效团队，这种变化正在催生全新的工作模式。”
数据显示，全球AI领域独角兽企业已达498家，我国已建成3.5万多个高质量数据集。孙克说：“我们往往高估技术的短期影响，低估长期影响。AI的未来，可能远超想象。”一组数据揭示了变革的深度：截至2025年8月，全球AI独角兽企业达498家，总估值2.7万亿美元；我国已建设高质量数据集超3.5万个，总量超400PB。孙克表示：“人类关于新技术对经济增长的预判，短期内一般是高估的，而长期内一般是低估的。”
制造升级　AI深入生产核心环节
制造业作为实体经济的主战场，正成为AI落地最深刻的试验场。中国信通院信息化与工业化融合研究所所长刘默指出：“如果说过去十年数字化转型解决提质降本增效问题，未来五年数智化更要解决创新和韧性问题。”
一个关键信号是，AI在制造业价值链中的渗透变化。魏凯分享的数据显示：AI应用在制造业的分布从“两端高、中间低”的微笑曲线，正在向生产制造核心环节延伸。“今年生产制造环节案例占比从19.9％增长至25.9％”，这一变化虽看似微小，却意味着AI正突破研发设计、营销服务的“舒适区”，向工艺更复杂、可靠性要求更高的生产一线挺进。
刘默提出了更具前瞻性的架构设想：“构建‘基础模型+数字孪生+智能体’新型架构，将大幅提升制造业智能分析决策能力。”这一架构中，基础模型负责知识管理与推理，数字孪生保障高可靠分析，智能体实现自主执行——三者协同，有望实现制造系统从自动化到自主化的质变。
热潮中的“冷”思考
总结专家学者的观点，记者发现，中国AI发展已经呈现三个新的明显特征：首先是从“工具”到“伙伴”：AI不再只是辅助工具，开始成为能独立完成任务的工作伙伴。其次是从“能用”到“好用”：技术突破后，如何让AI稳定可靠地工作，成为新挑战。最后是从“提升效率”到“创造价值”：AI正成为直接创造价值的新型“劳动力”。
然而，热潮中我们仍需清醒。魏凯提醒：“AI存在产生虚假信息、数据安全等风险，前沿技术甚至可能产生意料之外的行为。”因此，建立有效的安全管理机制至关重要。
展望未来，中国AI产业在规模突破万亿元后，正进入“做深做实”的新阶段。正如孙克所说：“AI的未知远大于已知。”在这个充满机遇的时代，我们既要拥抱创新，也要稳妥推进，让人工智能真正成为推动高质量发展的可靠伙伴。（记者　杨赞）

PMC Copyright notice    PMCID: PMC8572833  PMID: 34790889   Abstract  Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing all spheres of human life. From industrial processes to graphic design, the implementation of automated intelligent systems is changing how industries work. The spread of robots and AI systems has triggered academic institutions to closely examine how these technologies may affect the humanity—this is how the fields of roboethics and AI ethics have been born. The identification of ethical issues for robotics and AI and creation of ethical frameworks were the first steps to creating a regulatory environment for these technologies. In this paper, we focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America to create enforceable regulation for AI and robotics. We describe and compare ethical principles, policies, and regulations that have been proposed by government organizations for the design and use of robots and AI. We also discuss proposed international regulation for robotics and AI. This paper tries to highlight the need for a comprehensive, enforceable, and agile policy to ethically regulate technology today and in the future. Through reviewing existing policies, we conclude that the European Unition currently leads the way in defining roboethics and AI ethical principles and implementing them into policy. Our findings suggest that governments in Europe and North America are aware of the ethical risks that robotics and AI pose, and are engaged in policymaking to create regulatory policies for these new technologies.  Keywords: Roboethics, Ethics, Robotics, Artificial intelligence, Governance Introduction  Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are having a profound impact on all aspects of everyday life: our food is collected by robots, we are being driven by self-driving vehicles, our phones know what we want to text to our loved ones, and when we get sick, our physician might be a robot. However, as exciting as these technologies are, they come with significant risks for the future of humanity. Over the last 10 years, the number of industrial robots has risen 300% and continues to increase [ 1 ]. In the next 10 years, as many as 20 million jobs worldwide may be displaced by industrial robots [ 2 ]. Automated systems are replacing not only manual laborers, they are replacing care workers, teachers, lovers, medical professionals, and soldiers. It is highly likely that in the future robots will co-exist with humans and contribute to society both physically and intellectually. It is not just the future of jobs that worries the public, but also the possibilities for inequality, decline in social wellbeing, and non-consensual control from corporations and governments [ 3 , 4 ]. Due to these issues and the overall rise in robotics and AI research and implementation over the past decade, the development of ethical principles and regulation has become a priority for governments and organizations around the world.  The first attempts to understand the ethics of AI and robotics have come from academic institutions and private corporations, which demonstrates the field’s awareness of its potential implications. The study of the ethics of robotics, or roboethics, was pioneered by by Gianmarco Veruggio in the early 2000s [ 5 ]. Since then, roboethics and AI ethics have become widely discussed topics, with the number of publications mentioning either of the terms increasing tenfold in the last 5 years [ 6 ]. Although many organizations already propose well-considered ethical principles for robotics and AI, the need remains for enforceable ethical regulations on governmental and international levels. The need for regulation is felt by all members of the robotics and AI communities, which is why many non-government organizations have decided to create their own ethical policies independent of law and policy. However, this does not promote standardization of ethics, and allows for moral loopholes which could lead to creation of automated systems that infringe on human rights. Governments have recognized the potential and risks that AI and robotics bring, and have initiated the process for creation of legislation that accounts for ethical concerns in AI and robotics.  The goal of this paper is to summarize ethical frameworks and regulations in Europe and North America with specific focus on how ethical principles have been translated into law by government bodies in the European Union (EU), United States of America (U.S.), and Canada. This paper is structured as follows: we first provide a definition for robots and discuss how theoretical Laws of Robotics have initiated the discussion for ethical robots; we then move on to describe key ethical issues for robots; the following section describes ethical frameworks and regulations for Europe, North America, and as set out by international organizations such as the United Nations; lastly, we provide a brief discussion where we compare the progress made by Europe and North America in creating regulatory policies for robotics and AI, and list action-steps for establishing a regulatory environment that promotes ethical robotics and AI. Foundational principles of robotics and roboethics  While AI-powered robots are a thing of the present, there are examples of miraculous—for the time— machines from ancient civilizations which we can consider the first examples of robots. Al-Jazari, an Arab Muslim scholar from the thirteenth century BC designed wondrous items such as a programmable system for pouring and serving various drinks, a set of robotic musicians, and several water-raising machines [ 7 , 8 ]. Leonardo da Vinci has also created a humanoid-looking automaton in a shape of a knight that was able move its head and jaw, wave its arms, and sit up [ 9 ]. The Industrial Revolution populated new technologies around the world and has permanently changed how people approach manual labor. With the discoveries of electricity, computers, and the internet, inventors were able to create machines and automatons capable of automating processes that were previously performed by humans. A new revolution is currently underway in the workforce, and over 70% of US workers indicate that they are worried about a future when robots and computers can perform human jobs [ 3 ]. Similarly, in a study that surveyed over 20,000 EU workers, the majority has indicated that they agree that robots steal people’s jobs [ 10 ]. As the capabilities of machines have changed, our definitions for robots and.  Definition of robots  The term “robot” was first introduced by Karel Capek in a play that first premiered in Prague in 1921 [ 11 ]. The term, derived from Czech word “rabota” meaning compulsory work, was used to identify artificial laborers that served humans in a fictional Utopian society [ 11 , 12 ]. Since then, the word “robot” has been popularized through works of science fiction and is now also applied to an array of intelligent mechanical systems. When considering policy design and implementation, it is critical to have a most complete and accurate definition of a robot, since a policy may or may not be applied to an object depending on whether it is classified as a robot. One the most widely accepted definitions for robot is one from the Robot Institute of America: “A robot is a reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices, through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks” [ 13 ]. Since the development of AI and the Internet of Things, and the merging of programmable systems with physical operators, the distinction between AI and robots is become more arbitrary [ 14 ]. As such, perhaps the most straightforward definition for robot is “an embodied AI” [ 15 ].  With the above definitions in mind, a robot should exhibit these three properties [ 14 ]:   Programmability, or an ability for a designer to manipulate robot’s functions and capacities;  Mechanical Capability, enabling a robot to act on its surroundings; and  Flexibility, allowing the robot to operate in a variety of ways and adapt to different scenarios.   With the emergence of specific robot types, such as social robots, the qualities above may be expanded. This should be considered when attempting to create a policy that should only be applied to a specific type of a robot. While universal policies would be useful in establishing a basic governance of robots, it would be difficult to apply the same policy to a cargo-stacking robot, a self-driving car, and a robotic soldier. Asimov’s laws of robotics  The term robotics, referring to a branch of engineering that studies robots, was first used by Isaac Asimov in his novel “Runaround” [ 16 , 17 ]. In the same novel, Asimov has introduced the first set of laws that dictate a robot’s behavior [ 16 ]. These laws lay the foundation for roboethics and established the first set of boundaries between humans and robots. The Laws of Robotics (Laws) discuss concepts of safety, obedience, and self-preservation:   A robot may not injure a human being under any conditions—and, as a corollary, must not permit a human being to be injured because of inaction on [the robot’s] part.  A robot must follow all orders given by qualified human beings as long as they do not conflict with First Law.  A robot must protect [its] own existence, as long as that does not conflict with the First and Second Law.   Asimov later recognized that the First Law did not extend to the human society overall and added an additional Zeroth Law that would supersede the First Law [ 18 ]:   0. A robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.   While these laws were relevant when written in 1942 and 1985 (Clarke, 1993), they are not applicable to robotics today. The Laws employ abstract concepts and require robots to make moral judgements based on difficult-to-calculate probabilities [ 14 ]. When Asimov wrote his robots, he was not operating under constraints of reality and technological capability; he could take creative freedoms to smooth over any inconsistencies. To apply these Laws to the current state of robotics, they need to be revised with more specificity. However, when AI reaches the point of singularity, some of Asimov’s original Laws may become relevant again. Revisions to the Asimov’s laws of robotics  When Asimov proposed his Laws of Robotics, he could not envision the technological developments and the geopolitical climate of the twenty-first century. Building on the foundational principles of the Laws, several versions of the new Laws of Robotics have been proposed. According to Murphy and Woods, the main issues with the Laws are that they 1) assume that robots are solely responsible for human safety, 2) fail to explain how robots should interpret orders given by humans, and 3) ignore that many robots lack a self-protective component of autonomy [ 19 ]. As a result, the Three Laws of Responsible Robotics focusing on accountability, responsiveness, and control, have been proposed [ 19 ]:   A human may not deploy a robot without the human–robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics.  A robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles.  A robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control to other agents consistent with the first and second laws.   These updated laws recognize that as robots are created by humans, the responsibility for robot actions lies on humans too. Assignment of responsibility is essential when creating legislation and policy, as policy enforcement requires accountability. In addition to that, the Laws of Responsible Robotics recognize that robots are a part of dynamic relationships that are built through human–robot interactions [ 19 ]. These new Laws are not exhaustive nor specific, but they provide a more realistic starting point for ethicists and policy makers.  Since 2009 industries have revolutionized their work by employing cloud computing, big data, and cyber-physical systems [ 20 ]. The robot industry has reached the point where robots are able to provide an attractive return on investment for replacing manual labor with machines [ 21 ]. Some predictions suggest that the number of industrial robot installations will increase 300% in the next 10 years, and in some industries over 40% of manufacturing tasks will become automated [ 21 ]. These figures suggest that human–robot co-working is inevitable and will be the next step in industrial evolution. The changes in global industry require a new set of ethical robotics rules, which would protect human workers from capitalistic drivers and guarantee a peaceful coexistence of humans and robots in the same workplace. New technological developments have also spread to the military and medical sectors, where robots are able to perform such disparate functions as destroying terrorist cells and caring for the elderly. Increases in robotic and AI capabilities has inspired several organizations to develop new robotic principles and manifests [ 22 ]. Additionally, the New Laws of Robotics (New Laws) have been proposed in 2020, which take into account morals of human actors [ 23 ]:   Robotic systems and AI should complement professionals, not replace them;  Robotic systems and AI should not counterfeit humanity;  Robotic systems and AI should not intensify zero- sum arms races;  Robotic systems and AI must always indicate the identity of their creator(s), controller(s), and own er(s).   These New Laws, while not specific, reflect on the current trends in implementation of robots around the world. They take into account the most troubling trends in robotics today, and place hard restrictions on them. The New Laws, however, do not include restrictive language, and cannot be interpreted as a piece of regulatory policy. Given changes already observed in the field, it is likely that there will be other laws proposed in the future. This reflects on the iterative process in both technological developments and policymaking. Ethical questions for robotics policies  The development and marketization of robotics pose many ethical questions for researchers, practitioners, government, and society alike. These ethical questions lay a foundation for ethical principles, which in their turn facilitate creation of roboethical standards such as BS 8611 [ 24 ]. The combination of ethical frameoworks and standards informs creation of regulatory policies for robotics. In order to create relevant policy, governments and corporations have proposed various means of evaluating a robot. Here we discuss three categories based on which a robot can be evaluated to create ethical policy.  Functionality  Robots are designed to perform various functions, from assembly of heavy machinery to patient care. Most commonly robots are designed to perform tasks with utilitarian purpose, where a robot performs repetitive or heavy tasks in a workplace [ 17 ]. These robots are often referred to as industrial robots, and they have been responsible for revolutionizing production economies around the world [ 17 , 20 ]. Robots with more sophisticated mechanical functions were then adapted in medical fields, so we have seen the appearance of medical robots. Rapid advances in AI technology have facilitated development of a whole new class of robots- social robots. Social robots possess an ability to interact with humans, enabling them to perform caregiving, teaching, and customer service functions [ 25 – 27 ]. Outside of professional environment, robots are designed as toys, art objects, or exclusively for user pleasure [ 28 – 30 ]. Robots can now be expected to be involved in all aspects of human life, which undoubtedly will shape society and economy.  Robot’s intended functions can pose an array of ethical concerns. While the existence of industrial robots is somewhat accepted, there are questions being raised about how industrial robots will impact the workforce dynamics and the state of the world economy. Many workers are concerned about losing their jobs to robots, and industries are expecting that they will have to retrain their workers due to robot integration [ 3 , 31 , 32 ]. Some countries would be able to survive this industrial revolution, but for developing countries and regions relying on manual labor this change may prove to be disastrous [ 33 ]. Social robots present some of the similar challenges in relation to workforce dynamics, but also pose additional questions regarding dehumanization. Expansion of aging population has already caused Japan to look into robotic care for the elderly, and North America and Europe are likely to follow suit [ 34 , 35 ]. Robotic caregivers may be able to assist with physical side of patient care, but it has been widely acknowledged that human contact is just as important to care and therapy. Care robots are not able to empathize with their charges and could exacerbate the problem that they were designed to solve by perpetuating loneliness and eroding their patient’s sense of dignity [ 35 , 36 ]. Similar concerns can be raised in relation to robot childcare and education, where children may find themselves attached to robots in a way that would impact their social development [ 37 , 38 ]. It is plausible that in the future robots would be able to perform any function a human can, so current policymakers could start questioning which roles robots should play in human society.  A robot may also have functions that are complimentary to a robot’s main function. For example, a robot designed to entertain the elderly may also be collecting user data such as sound, video, etc. Social robots can access user’s physical spaces and gain insights on user’s innermost thoughts, which could be of special concerns if robots are interacting with vulnerable populations [ 39 ]. In this scenario, data handling and ownership pose additional ethical concerns which would need to be addressed through policy. If robots have internet connectivity and upload data to servers, data security would add another layer to the potential regulatory framework.  There is another class of robots whose function is widely debated on an international scale, and which deserve a special mention here: military robots. At least 50 countries have either bought robots for military purposes or have military robotics programs; the U.S. Department of Defense has allocated $7.5 billion to development of unmanned systems in the fiscal year 2021 [ 40 , 41 ]. Militaries around the world have been using robots to conduct reconnaissance, do surveillance, disarm landmines, and engage with targets [ 42 ]. It is the latter kind that is of outmost concern for the ethicists. Lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) offer several advantages for the military: they have a potential to reduce casualties, improve precision, and provide continuous surveillance and analysis of the battlefield [ 43 ]. To understand ethical concerns for LAWS, we should ask three questions: 1) What can they do? 2) What should they do? and 3) What is their role in global security and likelihood of future wars? [ 44 ] The concern for human dignity is central to ethics of LAWS: they could eliminate the human judgement component from lethal confrontations, thus shifting the ethical burden for taking a life from humans to a machine [ 44 , 45 ]. Whether LAWS should be able to make life and death decisions and follow up with violence based on that decision is the cornerstone question for ethicists and policymakers. Some researchers argue that LAWS should be under meaningful human control even after deployment, thus limiting the autonomy of such robots and still permitting for human-directed decision-making [ 42 ]. This point of view is supported by governmental organizations, for example the European Parliament resolution on a comprehensive European industrial policy on AI and robotics notes that “automated weapons systems should continue to have a human-in-command approach to artificial intelligence” [ 46 ]. A survey from 2015 has indicated that the majority of people opposes use of LAWS for offensive purposes and supports international ban of LAWS [ 47 ]. If International Humanitarian Law does allow the use of LAWS, it would be the up to robot engineers to create algorithms that determine the extent of human involvement for ethical robotic warfare [ 48 ]. Capability  While two robots might be designed to perform the same function, their capabilities may vary depending on a unit’s hardware and software. In other words, a robot that is only capable of simple processing operations cannot be compared to a robot that has sophisticated AI with a capacity for learning. The more advanced the AI, the more ethical questions can be raised to create regulatory policy. With AI that possesses human-like capabilities, one might even start asking whether such sophisticated robots deserve to have rights that would traditionally be granted to intelligent life forms. Further, if a robot starts to develop capacity for independent thought, would it be ethical for humans to regulate it as an object or a property? These questions could be further complicated by the anthropomorphization of robots, which would create an illusion of social bonding between a robot and a human [ 49 – 51 ]. Unlike the future concerns for human-like AI, social robots already present anthropomorphization concerns for the ethicists today. Humanization of robots can result in more positive attitudes towards robots, but also creates an unrealistic perception of robot capabilities [ 52 ]. It would be up to policymakers to weigh the pros and cons of robot humanization and decide whether regulation of robot design and social programming should be implemented.  If AI evolves to the point of human intelligence, it is also possible that robots will develop a capability of deception [ 53 ]. Ethics of deception in human behavior are widely debated, so incorporation of deception for robots presents a similar ethical challenge. The most common view of deception is that it is wrong to mislead others, especially for personal gain, but it might be acceptable to lie for a “greater good” [ 54 ]. If robots were to follow that rule of thumb, roboticists would have to define situations in which deception would be acceptable. In this case, the same moral and ethical standards extend from humans to robots. There are, however, some robot-specific forms of deception that cause special concern for robotics researchers. Dishonest anthropomorphism refers to robots using deceptive signals to conceal a capacity it possesses, or to suggest that is has a capacity that it does not possess [ 55 ]. For example, a social robot could overt it’s “gaze” pretending that it does not see a human when in fact it is recording via a hidden camera [ 56 ]. Regulatory policies would need to take into account robots’ deception ability and formulate rules for public awareness. Autonomy  Autonomy refers to a robot’s ability to perform operations and adapt to changes independently from humans. Balancing robot autonomy and human control is one of the core challenges in robotics from both ethical and technical perspectives [ 57 ]. This challenge is applicable for all types of robots, and the expectation is that robots should behave autonomously while performing both technical and social tasks [ 57 ]. Robots can be assessed based on the amount of autonomy they possess. Several scales have been created to assess autonomy levels in different kinds of robots. For example, Attanasio et. al. have ranked autonomy of surgical robots from 0 to 5, where 0 refers to robotic systems fully operated by the human surgeon, and 5 referring to systems that can perform surgery with no human input [ 58 ]. There are currently no surgical robots operating at Level 5 of Autonomy, but there are systems that operate at Level 4. This type of a surgical robot can interpret operative information, devise an action plan, adjust, and execute the plan while operating autonomously under surgeon’s supervision [ 58 , 59 ]. Higher levels of autonomy also bring up questions about moral responsibility and accountability. If a robot has an ability to make decisions, would the robot also be responsible for the consequences? This is an especially important question in the context of policy and legislation. There are currently several cases in court where Tesla self-driving cars were involved in accidents where people died [ 60 , 61 ]. These lawsuits might be critical in establishing precedent for accountability policies in autonomous robotics.  Robot’s level of autonomy influences how much humans trust robots. This is especially the case for robots that operate in human-rich environments, such as social robots and medical robots. A study surveying public’s opinion on surgical robots found that 69% of responders felt very uncomfortable about robots performing surgery without direct control from a surgeon [ 62 ]. Another study found that non-physicians were more likely to choose robotic surgery compared to physicians [ 63 ]. Since we can expect robots and humans to co-exist and collaborate, fostering trust for autonomous robots would be fundamental to their ability to perform their tasks. Policymakers will need to be cognizant of public’s perspectives and implement effective strategies in launching human–robot co-working arrangements [ 64 ].  The above sections suggest certain scenarios, factors, and concerns to consider surrounding the use of robotics in society. Implementation of robotics will have far-reaching effects on the future society. Diversity in robot functions, capabilities, and autonomy complicates the creation of a unified set of rules. However, the use of robotics may pose risks to different groups of individuals, and it is essential that the appropriate stakeholder is held responsible in harmful situations. Ultimately, the extent of ethical concern is informed by the human–robot interactions a particular robot can produce. Criteria like robot functionality, capability, contact with humans, and requirement for social skills may be taken into consideration in evaluating the ethics of human–robot interactions, and by extension the robot itself [ 65 ]. Public’s safety depends on policy and legislation, so it is critical that policymakers recognize ethical implications of individual human–robot interactions and effects robots have on society overall when creating policies to govern robotics. It should also be noted that we as humans create, use, and govern robots, which means that roboethics and robot regulation depend on ethical humans to create and uphold these frameworks. Roboethics and AI policies in North America and Europe  Creation of the regulatory framework for robotics is a lengthy multi-step process. Identification and distribution of ethical principles is the first step in creating relevant policy to govern the robotics field. A variety of organizations around the world has come up with their version of principles for ethical robotics. Governments and global organizations take these principles under advisement to create policies, thus translating best-practice suggestions into legislation. However, ethical guidelines often stay on as principles, thus creating an attractive loophole for companies to avoid regulation and legal persecution [ 66 ]. In cases where institutions integrate ethics into their mandate, it serves only as a marketing strategy and not a binding agreement [ 67 ]. One of the biggest gaps in AI and robotics ethical frameworks is the strict regulatory aspect. The next section examines the state of roboethics regulatory policies as proposed by international governing organizations, and North American and European governments. The policies discussed include executive orders, resolutions, proposals, and official reports commissioned by governmental agencies. Further, we have decided to include both AI and robotics policies in this overview. There are significant similarities in the ethics of robotics and AI, especially if we view robots as embodied AI [ 6 ]. The governments have also dedicated more attention to regulation of AI, most likely because AI technology is being actively incorporated in all aspects of life. It is also possible that as technology develops the line between robotics and AI will blur to the point that the distinction will be not important for the purposes of law [ 68 ]. It should be also noted that robotics technology is advancing faster than regulatory policies, so laws approved today may need to be changed in the future to reflect the state of the field of robotics [ 69 , 70 ]. The latter concern also reflects on the changing and philosophical nature of ethics, where creating long lasting laws might be a challenge.  European roboethics principles, policies and legislation  European policies for robotics are initiated by the European Parliament, the European Commission and by individual governments in the EU (also referred to as Member States). Given the trade and research partnerships that exist between European countries, legislation set out by the European Parliament and the European Commission has the most power to direct the field of robotics in Europe. Following this, the review focuses on the roboethics and AI principles set up by the European Parliament and Commission. Detailed descriptions for robotics and AI policies from individual countries can be found elsewhere [ 71 , 72 ].  European ethical framework for robotics  A study commissioned by the European Parliament Legal Affairs Committee on European civil law in robotics proposed a general ethical framework to be followed in future legislation by the Parliament. The framework focuses on roboethical principles that would protect humans from robots and covers concepts of safety, liberty, privacy, deception, and equality [ 73 ]. The 2017 resolution of the European Parliament on the civil law rules on robotics and AI prioritized six main areas for EU legislative efforts: ethics, liability, intellectual property and flow of data, standardization, employment and institutional coordination and oversight [ 74 , 75 ]. Additionally, the 2017 resolution included recommendations for a code of conduct for robotics scientists, where the role of ethical design and responsible research was recognized [ 75 ].  In a later statement published in 2018, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies listed roboethics principles that align with the current EU Treaties and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights [ 76 ]. These principles are summarized below:   Human dignity Autonomous technologies must not violate the inherent human right to be respected.  Autonomy Humans are free to live to by their own standards, and humans are responsible to exert control over autonomous technologies. Autonomous technologies must not impair human freedom, responsibility, and control.  Responsibility The development and use of autonomous technologies must benefit society and the environment on a global scale. Such benefits must be defined by democratic means.  Justice, equity, and solidarity Regulators and practitioners must prevent or neutralize discriminatory datasets from training AI systems. AI should further efforts in global justice and equality. All humans should benefit from autonomous technologies.  Democracy The regulation of autonomous technologies must result from democratic, public debate, and engagement.  Rule of law and accountability Regulation of autonomous technologies must uphold all human rights standards, such as protections for safety and privacy. These protections rely on rule of law, access to justice, the right to redress, and the right to a fair trial.  Security, safety, and bodily and mental integrity Safe autonomous systems promote external, internal, and emotional safety. External safety protects environments and users. Internal safety ensures consistent performance and protects against hacking. Emotional safety protects users from exploitation and abuse when interacting with autonomous machines.  Data protection and privacy Digital communication technologies employ autonomous technologies to amass and store vast quantities of users’ personal data. Therefore, autonomous technologies challenge protections on personal information and privacy.  Sustainability Autonomous technologies must align with our human responsibility to protect our planet’s ability to support life, to preserve the continued quality of the environment, and to maintain the prosperity of our species.   The roboethics principles, as defined by the European Commission in 2018, are further supplemented by the resolution on the European industrial policy on AI and robotics that was published in 2019 by the European Parliament [ 46 ]. The resolution recognizes the role of ethics in robotics and AI regulation and specifically focuses on four aspects of the roboethical framework: 1) human-centric technology; 2) embedded values in technology; 3) decision-making, and 4) transparency, bias and explainability of algorithms [ 46 ].  European commitment to ethical AI and robotics has since been re-confirmed by Ursula von der Leyen, the President-Elect of the European Commission. Her agenda for Europe specifically includes creation of standards for new generation of technologies and legislation for coordinated action on AI [ 77 ]. European Policies for Ethical Robotics and AI  European policy may be viewed from both national and international perspectives. Countries in the EU are free to set their own rules, but are also required to follow policy set out by the European Parliament and European Commission. In fact, current opinion of the European Union is that in term of ethical regulation for robotics and AI, there is a need for coordinated action between EU member states and the European Commission [ 74 ]. In order to create relevant policy, the EU has conducted thorough studies that informed the policymakers on current perspectives of stakeholders. This section summarizes these efforts and lays out key aspects of existing robotics regulatory framework in Europe.  Robolaw project  In 2012 the EU initiated a collaborative project RoboLaw to investigate how emerging technologies will challenge European legal systems and to survey the state of the existing robotics regulation [ 78 ]. The project produced a report with recommendations for the European Commission on regulating robotics and related technologies [ 78 , 79 ]. The report details two approaches to robotics legislation: 1) creation of new laws to accommodate the new technology and 2) adaptation of existing laws to reflect technology developments. In view of the scope of the robotics field, the authors argue that both approaches might need to be employed by policymakers [ 79 ]. To investigate this question further, RoboLaw authors chose a case-study approach where they profiled four specific robot types: self-driving cars, computer-integrated surgical systems, robotic prosthesis, and care robots [ 78 ]. This approach was especially effective in prioritizing human rights and identifying unique concerns that could be missed if a broader approach was employed. Further, while each type of a robot does present a unique legislative challenge, the authors were able to deduce common themes, such as liability, on which policymakers could act. Overall, the RoboLaw project has created a foundation for robotics regulation in the EU and promoted developments in the European legislature to accommodate robotics and AI regulation. European regulatory framework for ethical robotics and AI  EU and its members already possess a rich legislative framework that is capable of accommodating some of the roboethical principles outlined above. However, both the European Parliament and the European Commission, highlight the need for further evaluation of emerging technologies and acknowledge that current legal framework is not sufficient to address all challenges posed by robotics and AI [ 75 ]. The SIENNA Project, an EU initiative aimed at understanding of ethical and human rights challenges posed by new technologies, generated a report that maps existing EU legislation to key legal issues in robotics and AI [ 80 ]. Issues of safety, liability, privacy, and equity are amongst the most well-defined by the current laws [ 80 , 81 ]. Other ethical concerns for robotics, such as legal personhood for advanced AI systems, currently don’t have any existing legal framework. The latter is understandable given that AI has not reached that level of advance, but even for ethical issues that do have legal coverage, existing laws are not always specific to robotics. For example, product safety is extensively covered through Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety and Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on market surveillance [ 82 , 83 ]. These regulations were written more than 10 years ago and do not reflect on developments in digital technologies: issues such as connectivity, autonomy, algorithmic opacity, and data dependency are not explicitly discussed in the current legal product safety framework [ 81 ]. An additional challenge is presented by the variety of new technologies, where certain types of robots will need to be covered under additional legal frameworks. For example, transportation robots could be regulated though regulations such as Regulation (EU) 2018/858 on approval and surveillance of motor vehicles [ 73 , 84 ].  An alternative way to regulate AI was recently proposed by the European Commission: Proposal COM(2021)206 for harmonized rules on AI develops a legal framework based on risk-levels for AI systems [ 85 ]. This approach received positive feedback during an online public consultation with European stakeholders [ 86 ]. Higher assessed risk of an AI system would mean more stringent regulation from the EU and the member states. AI systems categorized as high risk included algorithms for education, law enforcement, and worker management [ 87 ]. A similar approach can be applied to robotics, especially in systems where AI and robotics converge into a single system. Evaluating a robot based on its functionality, capability, and autonomy can inform how much risk it poses to humans, and how it should be regulated. Risk-based regulation has several advantages over the traditional legal framework: 1) flexibility; 2) proportionality; 3) complementarity and consistency with the current legislation. It is the opinion of the European Commission that if risk-based framework is adopted by EU and the Member States, it will allow for innovation while ensuring respect for existing laws and values [ 85 ]. Ethical regulation of research and innovation  Research and innovation comprise one of the main focuses in the EU strategy for sustainable growth and prosperity. Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is a new governance model proposed by the EU that puts emphasis on co-creation and co-production with society [ 88 , 89 ]. RRI framework has three main features:   Emphasis on science for society, where research efforts are focused on the “right impacts”;  Development of mechanisms for reflection and inclusion, where research goals are achieved ethically, inclusively, and democratically; and  Responsibility, where RRI framework is applicable not only for researchers, but also entrepreneurs, policymakers, funding organizations, etc. [ 90 , 91 ].   When considering the implementation of the RRI, the European Commission identified four main options that ranged from a “business as usual” option (no further action required), to legally binding initiatives on that would promote RRI coordination between the EU member states [ 92 ]. To date, the EU has implemented several policies that reflect on RRI principles and launched numerous RRI projects via the Horizon 2020 program [ 93 ].  The Horizon 2020 program has funded €80 billion worth of projects, which include research initiatives, societal profiling for identification of unique challenges, and educational programs [ 93 , 94 ]. One of the most powerful ways to regulate research is by controlling funding. To receive funding from the Horizon 2020, Digital Europe, or European Defense Fund programs, an applicant must complete an ethics self-assessment if their proposed research is in areas with high ethical risk [ 95 ]. The self-assessment helps applicants ensure that their research will comply with applicable international, EU and national law, and also facilitates grant review with regard to responsible implementation and social acceptance [ 95 ]. Importantly, completion of the self-assessment is a part of one’s grant agreement and imposes binding obligations that may be verified through official channels. For artificial intelligence, and by extension robotics, the assessment relies on the guidelines proposed by the High-Level Expert Group on AI [ 96 , 97 ]. To be approved for funding, the project must follow key prerequisites for ethically sounds AI:   Human agency and oversight,  Technical robustness and safety,  Privacy and data governance,  Transparency,  Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness,  Societal and environmental wellbeing, and  Accountability [ 97 ].   Apart from the above prerequisites, grant applicants are invited to consider how their AI system may be used, and whether it can be utilized in especially dangerous manner, for example in weapon systems [ 95 ].  The EU has developed a robust multi-project framework to support their RRI efforts and conducted case-studies to understand best implementation strategies across EU Member States. One of the deliverables includes a handbook for organizations aimed at strengthening responsible research and innovation [ 98 ]. The handbook can be utilized by academic institutions to foster RRI among engineers-in-training, this creating professionals that would follow the EU directive for ethical by design robotic systems [ 99 ]. The diversity and expanse of RRI initiatives is likely to facilitate ethical implementation of robotics and AI in EU.  It is evident that Europe is currently actively implementing roboethics principles into policy. Europe’s approach to policymaking is characterized by thorough research, extensive survey of all stakeholders, and prioritization of common goals of growth, innovation, and sustainability. European governing bodies are aware of the weaknesses of the existing legislation and have created a comprehensive list of enhancements that would bring legal frameworks for robotics and AI to the next level [ 100 ]. Overall, the EU’s commitment to democratic policymaking fosters close relationships between industry, academia, and government, which creates a collaborative environment for relevant policymaking. North American policies for ethical robotics and AI  America has the least number of robot units sold or shipped as compared to Europe and Asia [ 101 ]. This difference can be explained by a variety of factors such as economic policy, cultural climate, funding for innovation, and regulatory framework. Unlike Europe, North America does not have a unified governance system, so this section will explore roboethics principles and policies in the United States of America and Canada. Both countries represent unique governance frameworks that significantly differ from the European legislative system. In both the U.S. and Canada, federal laws are supplemented by state and province legislation, thus complicating the creation of a unified regulatory framework for robotics. Additionally, the Canadian and American common law systems rely heavily on precedent setting case law, where regulation is created based on precedents; this is especially troubling for emerging technologies such as AI and robotics because ethical issues might not be immediately brought up in the court system. There are also cultural differences between Europe and North America- where the EU places a lot of emphasis on sustainable growth, stakeholder engagement, and democracy, the U.S. is heavily focused on productivity and economic growth [ 102 ]. As such, there is a paucity of government-set ethical frameworks for AI and robotics. Here we discuss the existing regulatory and ethical frameworks for robotics and AI in North America.  American ethical frameworks for robotics and AI  U.S. interest in AI and robotics leadership is evident: several executive orders, memorandums, reports, and strategies from the Office of the President outline U.S. national goals for AI development and leadership [ 102 – 105 ]. The National Science and Technology Council has published a strategic plan for AI research, where the Council recommends development of a framework that would support effective AI innovation and ethical implementation [ 106 ]. The U.S. Congress has also passed the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 which established the National AI Initiative to help coordinate AI-related activities across U.S. Departments and Agencies [ 107 ]. On February 11, 2019 President Trump signed an executive order which presents five principles for the American AI Initiative. These principles reflect on several core themes:   Commitment to AI development and implementation to support economic competitiveness and national security;  Creation of technical standards for AI deployment and adaptation;  Education of the public to help people develop skills necessary in the future (when AI will become more prominent);  Fostering of public trust and confidence in AI technologies and protection of civil liberties, privacy, and American values;  Creation of international environment that would support American AI industries [ 104 ].   These principles reflect on core ethical values of safety and trust, but don’t provide enough detail to be read as regulatory policy. The majority of specific ethical principles and frameworks are released by individual departments, such as the Department of Defense (DOD), the Depa', 'In this paper, we focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America to create enforceable regulation for AI and robotics.', NULL, 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8572833/', '{"market": {"game": "AI and robotics", "state": "EU, North America", "jackpot": null, "revenue": null, "mom_change": null, "yoy_change": null, "draw_number": null, "report_date": "2021-10-01", "key_findings": ["Focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America", "Creation of enforceable regulation for AI and robotics", "Emphasis on roboethics principles and policies", "Collaboration among various academic institutions", "Research and development in the field of robotics"], "sales_volume": null, "ticket_price": null, "domain_payload": {"asp": null, "domain": "embodied_ai", "region": "EU, North America", "segment": "AI and robotics", "highlights": ["Focus on regulatory efforts in Europe and North America", "Creation of enforceable regulation for AI and robotics", "Emphasis on roboethics principles and policies", "Collaboration among various academic institutions", "Research and development in the field of robotics"], "mom_growth": null, "yoy_growth": null, "market_size": null, "report_date": "2021-10-01", "model_or_version": null, "deployment_volume": null, "financing_or_order_amount": null}}, "entities_relations": {"entities": [], "relations": [{"date": null, "object": "AI", "subject": "Europe", "evidence": "", "predicate": "regulates", "confidence": 0.5}, {"date": null, "object": "robotics", "subject": "North America", "evidence": "", "predicate": "regulates", "confidence": 0.5}, {"date": null, "object": "AI", "subject": "Roboethics", "evidence": "", "predicate": "reports_on", "confidence": 0.5}]}}', '2026-02-26 14:34:23.490839+00', '2026-02-26 17:55:07.100592+00', 118);

The trend reflects China’s signature approach to AI, which recognizes diverse paths to AI dominance vis-à-vis the large models favored in the United States. This report documents PRC support for AI embodiment, describes how it is understood by China’s research community, and maps out the related infrastructure.  Download Full Report      Executive Summary  This report examines China’s embrace of embodied AI—artificial intelligence integrated with physical systems (robots, drones, vehicles, etc.)—as a critical pathway toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).  In the United States and Europe, large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants are regarded by many AI scientists and major AI companies as the most promising path to AGI, despite known issues with abstraction and reasoning.  By contrast, in China there is a broader vision of how AGI can be achieved, most recently expressed in a nationwide move toward AI embodiment—namely, intelligence developed through interaction between body, brain, and environment, in both physical and virtual forms.  This trend toward embodied AI is backed by policy support at the national and local government levels, which has led to large embodied AI innovation centers linked to top universities and tech firms being established in coastal cities and provinces.  The upshot is China is on a path to accomplish two goals simultaneously: enriching the nation by integrating AI into the economy and achieving AGI that is more aligned with the totality of human expression.  The report recommends that the United States and its allies ramp up their monitoring of China’s AI progress, benchmark its claims, and consider broader approaches to AGI beyond scaling up LLMs.   Download Full Report  China’s Embodied AI: A Path to AGI      Authors  William Hannas  Huey-Meei Chang  Valentin Weber  Daniel Chou    Topics   Compete    Peer Watch     Citation William C.

PDF Link Copied By  Pavlo Zvenyhorodskyi and Scott Singer Published on  Nov 24, 2025 Additional Links Full Text (PDF) On what at first glance appeared to be an ordinary workday in March this year at the factory of China’s leading EV manufacturer, Zeekr, a small team of workers went about their usual tasks: lifting boxes, assembling car parts, and performing quality checks. But unlike any typical shift, none of them paused to rest or even stopped for a drink of water. The reason—they were not human. These UBTech robots, powered by a multimodal reasoning model based on DeepSeek R1, were the first publicly known group of humanoid robots deployed as a coordinated team to carry out a wide range of tasks in a complex, real-world industrial setting. 1 Just a few months later, UBTech unveiled the Walker S2, the world’s first humanoid robot capable of autonomously changing its own batteries—potentially enabling uninterrupted, twenty-four-hour operation on the factory floor without any human assistance. 2  These demonstrations offer a glimpse into leading Chinese companies’ ability to translate frontier AI capabilities into useful real-world industrial applications. More significantly, these private sector achievements have become central to Beijing’s evolving national AI strategy, which seeks to leverage China’s combined strengths in AI software and robotics hardware to achieve a distinctive form of technological leadership. While Washington and most of Silicon Valley focus primarily on scaling large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and digital AI applications, Beijing has placed a fundamentally different bet. It believes that true AI dominance will come from systems capable of autonomous operation in the physical world—AI-powered robotics, commonly known as embodied AI. To achieve its ambitions in embodied AI, the Chinese government is rolling out a familiar technological development playbook: encouraging local governments to experiment with different approaches to develop and scale the technology. In response to Beijing’s call, provinces are channeling investment into local companies working on AI systems that can learn from human workers on factory floors, navigate complex physical environments, and bridge the gap between digital reasoning and real-world action. If China can achieve its vision, embodied AI could potentially solve some of China’s most pressing domestic challenges, including turbocharging its sluggish economy and addressing social challenges like its aging population. It could also yield a broad-based set of strategic advantages. Building a mature embodied AI ecosystem and securing durable global leadership in this area could, in theory, form a key pillar of China’s future economic and military power, and place it ahead in the global race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). But how does China plan to do this, and what obstacles stand in the way? This paper addresses that question by examining how the Chinese government conceives of embodied AI, the steps it is taking to advance it, and the ecosystem’s strengths and weaknesses. The paper also sheds light on how progress in embodied AI could reshape China’s economy, strengthen its national competitiveness, and impact the world. What Is Embodied AI? In both the West and China, embodied AI is generally understood as AI-powered hardware systems that can perceive and interpret multimodal inputs from the physical environment, including by sight, sound, and touch. They make autonomous decisions, carry out physical actions in the real world, and learn from those interactions. 3  Embodied AI is generally understood as AI-powered hardware systems that can perceive and interpret multimodal inputs from the physical environment, including by sight, sound, and touch. Importantly, while embodied AI is often associated with humanoid robots, which mimic the appearance and functions of humans, the two are not synonymous. Humanoids are machines defined by their human-like physical appearance, but their functional capabilities vary greatly depending on their software, sensing, and control systems. In practice, many humanoid robots remain limited-purpose systems, only capable of performing narrowly defined tasks, such as sitting at a reception desk and waving at visitors. The defining feature of embodied AI systems, on the other hand, does not lie in their physical form (see figure 1). These systems can take multiple physical forms, with humanoid robots being only one example; others include quadrupeds, drones, autonomous vehicles, industrial manipulators, and microbots. Industrial robots, for example, have long automated repetitive work on assembly lines even without generative AI. What defines embodied AI systems instead are their capabilities. They integrate advanced software, sophisticated sensors, and intricate control systems that enable a high degree of autonomous decisionmaking, adaptability to dynamic environments, and the ability to perform diverse tasks—for instance, completing all stages of a car production line traditionally handled by human workers.   Embodied AI systems are typically equipped with a rich set of sensors and are powered by multimodal AI models that support perception, reasoning, and action. These models typically draw on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using them as the linguistic and reasoning backbone to which vision- and action-modules are added.  Embodied AI systems stand apart for their ability not only to interpret data but also to interact with and adapt to diverse physical environments. This sets them apart from conventional applications, in which AI enhances mostly single-purpose tools and services, such as CT diagnostic assistants or weather prediction models. It also distinguishes them from software-based “agents,” which act purely in digital environments. 4 In practice, embodied AI has fuzzy boundaries and is more of a spectrum than a singular, easily recognized threshold. The lower end of this spectrum, comprising systems capable of performing a limited range of real-world tasks, such as UBTech’s Walker S2, has already been developed. However, neither China nor the West have achieved the fully autonomous systems grounded in continuously updated world models that some imagine as the foundation for embodied AGI. Western and Chinese research communities differ in the amount of attention and resources they are allocating to studying embodied AI. In the United States, most interest in embodied AI appears to be confined to the private sector. Big tech players such as Tesla, with its autonomous vehicles and smart robot Optimus, are making substantial investments in embodied AI. 5 Meanwhile, emerging companies such as Figure AI, which produces general-purpose humanoid robots, are also gaining traction, securing substantial external funding. 6 By contrast, in China, enthusiasm for embodied AI extends well beyond the private sector. Since the beginning of this year, the country’s expert community has witnessed a rapid surge of interest in embodied AI, with the topic rapidly gaining prominence in both policy and academic discussions. 7 Embodied AI: A Physical World Extension into the Real Economy The rise of embodied AI in Chinese policy discourse has not emerged in a vacuum. China’s embodied AI push reflects a deliberate effort by the government to translate advances in generative AI from the purely digital realm into what Beijing frequently refers to as the real economy: sectors encompassing the production of tangible goods and essential services that underpin economic activity in the physical world. In so doing, China hopes to revitalize its economy amid recent slow economic growth. 8  China’s embodied AI push reflects a deliberate effort by the government to translate advances in generative AI from the purely digital realm into what Beijing frequently refers to as the real economy. The idea that the real economy constitutes the foundation of China’s economic strength and must therefore be the primary focus of domestic AI adoption is deeply rooted in President Xi Jinping’s economic thought. Xi’s views on the economy were shaped in part by lessons from the 2008 global financial crisis. According to an analysis by the Chinese Communist Party’s Institute of Party History and Literature, the crisis exposed the risks of excessive reliance on the virtual economy—nonphysical forms of economic activity such as financial services and digital platforms. 9 Since becoming party general secretary in 2012, Xi has repeatedly called for the deep integration (深度融合) of the digital economy with the real economy, 10 which he regards as the key to China’s long-term growth. 11 Therefore, when the release of DeepSeek’s R1 model in January 2025 made it clear that China’s capabilities in AI were becoming increasingly mature, 12 the party likely concluded that the time had come to transition AI into the real economy. This conclusion was likely reinforced by the pressing need to revive economic growth amid China’s property-market crisis, sluggish domestic consumption, and the beginnings of population decline. 13 Building on China’s earlier advances in hardware systems such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and drones, Beijing sought to leverage embodied AI as one of the key tools to facilitate this transition. The party’s emerging focus on embodied AI has crystallized across several important reports and speeches after the DeepSeek moment. The March 2025 annual Government Work Report identified embodied AI alongside biomanufacturing, quantum technologies, and 6G as core tools for building the industries of the future. 14 While embodied AI has emerged as a new focus, the party has made clear that LLMs remain an important, complementary element of Beijing’s AI agenda. For example, Premier Li Qiang’s July 2025 keynote speech at the World AI Conference highlighted embodied AI alongside LLMs as areas of AI currently experiencing major breakthroughs. 15 Most recently, the CCP Central Committee recommended incorporating embodied AI as one of the new drivers of economic growth in China’s forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. 16 The Central Committee’s decision offers the clearest indication to date that the CCP leadership intends to place a long-term strategic bet on embodied AI, expecting it to play a defining role in shaping China’s future. What Beijing Hopes to Achieve with Embodied AI Embodied AI could help Chinese leadership achieve five concrete goals across three key dimensions: domestic, strategic, and comprehensive (see figure 2). Domestically, embodied AI could help address structural economic and demographic challenges. Strategically, it could strengthen China’s position amid global technological and geopolitical competition. Its third objective is crosscutting: achieving AGI in its truest form by creating general AI fully capable of autonomously interacting in the physical world.   Goal 1: Catalyze Economic Growth Domestically, Beijing seeks to use the development and deployment of embodied AI to significantly boost productivity in key industries, such as manufacturing and logistics, that are critical to revitalizing China’s slowing economic growth. This goal is articulated in the 2024 “Report on the Development of Embodied AI” co-authored by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), 17 a research body under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The report’s authors note that embodied AI could be leveraged to revolutionize human-machine collaboration, enabling autonomous hardware systems to learn from human coworkers through natural language interfacing, gestures, and motion. CAICT imagines potentially transformative economic impact and claims that over time these systems could replace humans as the most flexible units on industrial production lines, significantly boosting productivity. Goal 2: Address Aging Population Additionally, the CAICT report identifies embodied AI as a means of addressing China’s rapidly aging population that is expected to pose a serious challenge to the country’s economic growth. Embodied AI systems could substitute for human labor in roles typically affected by worker shortages due to the undesirable or hazardous nature of the tasks, such as those that might expose people to extreme temperatures. They could also provide eldercare services, thereby easing the burden on working-age individuals who, according to Chinese cultural norms, would otherwise be responsible for caring for aging family members. Goal 3: Strengthen the Military In addition to its role in advancing the AI frontier, Beijing also regards embodied AI as a technology capable of significantly enhancing the country’s military capabilities. The official news outlet of China’s People’s Liberation Army, PLA Daily , assesses that embodied AI could help China overcome human physiological limitations, redefine the boundaries of unmanned warfare, and give rise to a more agile and efficient combat system. 18 It envisions embodied AI systems that integrate multimodal sensors—such as vision, sound, touch, and even smell—with large multimodal models to autonomously observe their environment, make decisions, and act on the battlefield. Unlike current unmanned systems, which generally still require varying levels of human involvement, these embodied AI systems would offer a much higher degree of real-time tactical autonomy, making them significantly more resilient to electronic warfare interference. They would no longer be mere order executors, but commander-fighters capable of making adjustments in response to changing battlefield conditions. Goal 4: Gain Geoeconomic Advantage In addition to addressing economic and societal challenges, embodied AI could provide the Chinese government with substantial geoeconomic advantages. If Beijing effectively leverages its vast manufacturing capacity, it could emerge as the world’s leading supplier of embodied AI systems—creating a level of dependence on Chinese technology that might surpass earlier global reliance on emerging technologies such as 5G networks or solar panels. Unlike those technologies, embodied AI has the potential to become a foundational tool for automating a wide spectrum of physical tasks across the global economy, meaning that access to such systems could ultimately determine a country’s future economic competitiveness. Recognizing these stakes, Beijing has already begun laying the institutional groundwork for the global diffusion of embodied AI. Through its recent Global AI Governance Action Plan and AI+ International Cooperation Initiative, 19 China has sought to position itself as the partner best equipped to deliver practical AI applications tailored to the development needs of other countries. It has also announced the creation of a new platform for sharing these applications, the World AI Cooperation Organization (WAICO). 20 While China is currently concentrating on exporting more general AI applications, once embodied AI matures, it could use these established diffusion channels to spread the technology globally—even if it faces real economic constraints. Goal 5: Achieve AGI In addition to addressing domestic challenges, some key Chinese thought leaders see embodied AI as a means of accelerating the country’s frontier AI capabilities.  For example, the CAICT report argues that embodied AI could help advance the ambition of achieving AGI.  The view that embodied AI offers the most promising path toward AGI is echoed by influential Chinese scholars such as Zhang Bo, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor at Tsinghua University. 21 Zhang argues that while LLMs have laid a crucial foundation for AGI by enabling machines to understand and generate human language, it is embodied AI that will ultimately allow AI to replicate the full spectrum of human capabilities. He attributes this to embodied AI’s ability to interact with and learn from the physical world, which he sees as essential for achieving true general intelligence. 22  What the Chinese Government is Doing to Make It Happen By listing embodied AI among its key priorities in this year’s Government Work Report, the Chinese leadership has indicated that it is determined to accelerate its development. The government hopes to encourage academia and local authorities to explore and pilot potential development strategies that could later be scaled up nationally. This “pilot first, scale later” approach is not new—it has long been an important tool in Beijing’s innovation policy implementation. It was first employed in the 1980s by Deng Xiaoping during the Reform and Opening Up period, when he established special economic zones in cities like Shenzhen, allowing local governments to experiment with market-oriented reforms before scaling the most successful policies nationwide. 23 More recently, the People’s Bank of China adopted this approach for digital currency deployment, launching pilot programs in cities such as Hangzhou and Shenzhen to test the use of the digital renminbi (RMB) with a view toward a nationwide rollout in the future. 24  Following the government’s encouragement, embodied AI has become the subject of an increasing number of scholarly discussions, exhibitions, and conferences across China. One notable example is the annual China Embodied AI Conference, co-organized by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence and major Chinese universities active in AI and robotics research and talent development, such as Tsinghua and Tongji. 25 Its second annual meeting, held in 2025, culminated in the publication “15 Key Research Directions in Embodied Intelligence,” which highlighted priorities such as multimodal embodied perception, embodied world model construction, and embodied AI safety. 26 This document, reportedly the first systematic roadmap for embodied AI development in China, is poised to provide the government with a clearer sense of priorities in future funding allocation. Various Chinese provincial and municipal governments have sought to position themselves as pioneers for future nationwide policy. At the same time, various Chinese provincial and municipal governments have sought to position themselves as pioneers for future nationwide policy. Many have launched their own initiatives, but a few stand out due to the scale, ambition, and visibility of their efforts. In particular, the authorities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hubei—who are traditionally among the wealthiest in China and have a strong track record of spearheading development of emerging industries through ambitious policy initiatives—have so far taken the lead. 27 These regions have adopted diverse approaches to shaping the development of embodied AI, varying both in their emphasis on different segments of the production chain and in the strategies used to incentivize and support local industry. They have also sought to allocate resources more strategically, focusing on areas of embodied AI development where local companies already hold a relative advantage. For example, Beijing, home to one of China’s leading AI chip developers, Cambricon, 28 has prioritized elements such as high-performance chips tailored for embodied AI applications. 29 Shanghai—headquarters of Hesai Technology, 30 a national leader in sensor technologies for autonomous vehicles—has concentrated on core hardware components. 31  At the same time, governments in Guangdong and Zhejiang have focused on complete embodied AI platforms, specifically multipurpose humanoid robotics. These regions already hold a competitive edge with companies such as Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics and Hangzhou-based Unitree Robotics leading private sector developments in the embodied AI field. Meanwhile, the Hubei provincial government has focused its efforts on another niche of embodied AI platforms: smart vehicles. It has leveraged the resources of local Dongfeng Motor—one of China’s largest car manufacturers—and established the Laboratory for Embodied Intelligence Technology in Automobiles. 32 To support these efforts, the provincial governments have pledged varying levels of funding. For instance, Beijing has launched a 100 billion RMB (approximately $14.3 billion) investment fund with a fifteen-year lifespan to support AI and robotics. 33 Meanwhile, Shanghai has established an embodied AI fund, with an initial closing of 560 million RMB (approximately $77 million). 34 However, this largely devolved, local government-driven strategy is not without downsides. While provinces appear to be attempting to specialize in different segments of embodied AI, the lack of detailed guidance from Beijing risks leading to duplication of efforts and misallocation of resources. A parallel can be drawn with the electric vehicle sector. Fierce inter-provincial competition and overinvestment in local manufacturers produced staggering levels of economic waste and industrial overcapacity. 35 Yet the evolution of China’s world-leading EV industry also demonstrates that this seemingly wasteful competition can, over time, generate genuine technological breakthroughs. As with EVs, local government efforts in embodied AI could foster the rise of national champions and provide Beijing with clearer models of how to scale emerging technologies that can later be replicated at the national level. Ultimately, whether the approach of devolving the initial development of embodied AI to local governments succeeds will depend on several factors. First, national success likely hinges on local governments effectively dividing responsibility across different segments of the embodied AI supply chain and avoiding excessive duplication. Second, success will also depend on whether sufficient and sustainable financing will be available to support the long-term growth of local embodied AI companies. The latter may prove difficult given the substantial debt many local governments have accumulated over the past decade. This debt was driven by provincial governments responding to Beijing’s national growth targets, which encouraged heavy borrowing for investment in infrastructure and manufacturing such as electric vehicles, regardless of returns. 36 Third, technological advances could plateau, and fundamental breakthroughs could be limited. Whether embodied AI systems will ultimately match the dexterity, adaptability, and efficiency of human workers remains uncertain and could take far longer than many current industrial plans assume. 37 Where The Industry Stands and Where It Is Headed While the role of academia and local governments is crucial, Beijing’s bet on embodied AI ultimately hinges on the industry’s ability to deliver breakthroughs that will make the technology cost-effective and scalable. That effort is already well underway. National champions are already emerging across key sectors in China’s embodied AI industry: Unitree and UBTech in humanoid robotics, 38 DJI in drones, 39 and Baidu Apollo and XPeng in autonomous vehicles. 40 In each of these cases, industry-driven capabilities in robotics, manufacturing, and EVs formed the foundation for integrating AI into existing company infrastructures. China’s advantage in embodied AI lies in its robust hardware manufacturing base and supply chain, which could position it to rapidly scale production once the technology matures. Compared to the rest of the world, China’s advantage in embodied AI lies in its robust hardware manufacturing base and supply chain, which could position it to rapidly scale production once the technology matures. 41 This includes cost-effective manufacturing of embodied AI hardware platforms such as robots and drones, as well as some key components of embodied AI systems, such as LiDAR, the sensor technology essential for 3D mapping and environmental navigation. 42 As the world’s largest manufacturer, China also holds a competitive edge in the diversity and abundance of real-world application scenarios, which generate rich datasets critical for training embodied AI systems—many of which are intended for use in production lines. 43 However, Chinese developers often struggle to access this data, prompting some industry leaders to call on the government to grant companies access to datasets held by government agencies and state-owned enterprises. 44  Much like the rest of the world, China’s embodied AI technology remains at a relatively early stage, with the industry still lacking a complete commercial cycle. It largely remains confined to R&D, small-batch production, and pilot applications in specific scenarios, with key components such as balance and motion control software still under development. 45  However, major industry players are increasingly pushing to accelerate large-scale production and deployment. UBTech, for instance, recently secured a 250 million RMB (approximately $35 million) order for its Walker S2 industrial humanoid robots from an undisclosed domestic company. 46 China’s comparative weaknesses, on the other hand, include limited access to advanced AI chips and compute for both training and inference of models used in embodied AI systems. It still trails the West, though it is making steady progress. 47 Another key limitation lies in multidimensional sensors, such as torque sensors and six-axis force sensors for high-precision force measurement and perception in embodied AI systems, where China still relies heavily on Western imports. 48  Despite these limitations, most Chinese experts and industry leaders believe that the country’s existing advantages, combined with steady progress in lagging areas and sustained government support, could enable steady technological progress in embodied AI within the next five to ten years. 49 This progress would culminate in the development and deployment of AI systems capable of performing physical work in real-economy settings, advancing Xi Jinping’s conceptual objective for the use of AI in the real economy. 50 Meanwhile, some Chinese experts, such as Huang Tiejun, Director of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence—one of China’s leading AI labs working on embodied AI—have made longer-term predictions. Huang has suggested that embodied AI could fully surpass human capabilities by 2045. 51  Conclusion Beijing is making a long-term strategic bet on embodied AI, viewing it as a potential solution to many of China’s economic, social, and geopolitical challenges. Yet, whether this gambit succeeds, and in what ways, remains uncertain. Technological breakthroughs may prove elusive, and high levels of local debt could constrain sustained investment. Nevertheless, Chinese leadership appears determined to push forward, committing substantial political will and financial resources to make embodied AI a viable and scalable technology. Should Beijing develop fully commercially applicable embodied AI systems ahead of other countries, it would likely leverage its comparative advantages—a robust manufacturing base, comprehensive supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of factories where robots are likely to be deployed in the future—to rapidly scale up production and position itself as a dominant player in the global embodied AI systems market. In such a scenario, the world could depend on Chinese embodied AI technologies across critical economic sectors, including manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and service industries. It would also greatly strengthen China’s capabilities in autonomous warfare, potentially influencing the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific and beyond—especially if China chooses to export military applications of embodied AI to countries such as Russia. And if embodied AI ultimately holds the key to unlocking true AGI, Beijing could hold a decisive edge in its frontier AI rivalry with Washington. How the United States responds to this challenge will not just determine the trajectory of AI development but also shape the balance of economic and military power in the decades ahead.

Technology topic  Robotics (R)  The Robotics topic covers robot intelligence and experiential learning, particularly in the areas of high-performance processors or hardware that provides situational awareness and improved artificial intelligence. Innovations in voice, obstacle and image recognition, emotional response and hand-eye coordination are encouraged. We encourage proposals describing projects that borrow features from other animal nervous systems and include biologists, neuroscientists and psychologists on their team to exploit new knowledge in the study of the brain and behavior. NSF also seeks proposals that address next-generation automation; the flexible and rapid reconfiguration of assembly lines allowing mass customization; the use of advanced control, scheduling, modularization, and decentralization with agile, mobile robotic systems that can enable the cost-effective manufacture of small lot-size products; and on-demand parts manufacturing. Proposals to support the physical and educational needs of individuals with disabilities (e.g., vision, hearing, cognitive, motor related) are sought. Robotic applications in healthcare, smart drones and drone networks are appropriate. Medical devices focused on providing new capabilities to doctors including surgery; robotic exoskeletons to enhance human strength; personal robots with an emphasis on human-centered end use and interaction, personal caregiving and increased autonomy; future of work; flying taxis; reverse engineering the human brain; robot sense, motion, thought, and emotion; human-robot art; and robots of augmentation are welcome. Subtopics are not aimed at supporting or conducting clinical trials, clinical efficacy or safety studies, the development pre-clinical or clinical-stage drug candidates or medical devices, or work performed primarily for regulatory purposes. Limited studies with human subjects may be acceptable to the extent that they are performed in support of feasibility, such as proof-of-concept studies of early-stage technologies. Proposals that request support for clinical studies will be deemed noncompliant with the SBIR/STTR solicitations and returned without review.  Sub-Topics  R1.

At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents. NSF does not fund companies that are majority-owned by multiple venture capital firms, private equity firms, or hedge funds, to participate in SBIR and STTR.  All funded work, including work done by consultants and contractors, needs to take place in the United States.  The project’s principal investigator (tech lead) must be legally employed at least 20 hours a week by the company seeking funding. The principal investigator doesn’t need any advanced degrees.  The principal investigator needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of work on a funded project per six months of project duration.

Use Cases  Find out which use cases are being addressed and which technologies are being used in the Robotics category.         Regional Innovation Clusters  Identify emerging regional innovation clusters across the country, for Robotics technologies and innovations.               Highlights from our ongoing analysis   The United States currently lacks the appropriate institutional framework and accompanying operational procedures to support robotics, automation, and ad­vanced manufacturing. This is because industry, government, and academia are largely unlinked and often operate independently, and there is a similar lack of interagency coordination within the Government. To narrow this gap and bolster the country’s growth, the Department of Energy (DOE) in 2023 revealed a $22 million initiative to support 12 state-run programs to expedite the adoption of smart manufacturing at small- and medium-sized facilities. This initiative, funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, intends to enhance access to smart manufacturing technologies and high-performance computing within the U.S. manufacturing sector. Furthermore, in August 2023, The Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing (ARM) Institute shortlisted eight new short-cycle technology projects and plans to award a total contribution of approximately $3.26M for funding through its 23-01 Technology Project Call.    The objective of this report is to cover the federal R&D landscape by examining investments made through SBIR/STTR, Grants, and Other Transactions Awards during FY2018-FY2022.    Some high-level insights include:  Over $6B spent on Robotics, Automation, and Advanced Manufacturing-related R&D by the U.S. federal government signifying a 222% growth during FY2018-FY2022.  52% of robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing-related federal R&D awards were made through grants worth $3.1B during FY18-FY22. During the same time period, $900M worth of SBIR/STTR awards were awarded for robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing-related R&D awards.  Use Cases - Market verticals where technology adoption is highest include Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare, Logistics & Warehouse, Retail & Consumer Goods, and Automotive. Examples of high frequency use cases being invested in include surveillance and reconnaissance, robot-assisted surgery, 3D printing, sorting and assembling, goods transportation, product delivery, automated shelf-stocking etc.  Agencies - DOD and DOC have awarded more than 65% of R&D awards. Within DOD, the Dept. of Air Force, Army, Navy, DLA, and DARPA are making the most R&D investments. Other prominent civilian agencies include NSF, HHS, DOE, NASA, and DOA which comprises $1.7B worth of robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing-related awards.  2K+ Suppliers and Research Institutions were awarded robotics, automation, and advanced manufacturing R&D awards during FY18-FY22; Only 22% of awardees were underserved. SBIR/STTR program has utilized the highest proportion of underserved suppliers with 37%, OTAs utilized 24% underserved suppliers whereas grants had the lowest share of underserved suppliers at 11%.  Emerging Regional Innovation Clusters - Various innovation clusters are emerging in regions such as Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (DC-VA-MD-WV), Ann Arbor (MI), Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue (WA), etc. These R&D innovation “hotbeds” have attracted the highest proportion of R&D investments.

Our experts identify actionable best practices and incentives for industry and government leaders on artificial intelligence, cyber threats, cloud security, countering influence operations, reducing the risk of biotechnologies, and ensuring global digital inclusion. Learn More On what at first glance appeared to be an ordinary workday in March this year at the factory of China’s leading EV manufacturer, Zeekr, a small team of workers went about their usual tasks: lifting boxes, assembling car parts, and performing quality checks. But unlike any typical shift, none of them paused to rest or even stopped for a drink of water. The reason—they were not human. These UBTech robots, powered by a multimodal reasoning model based on DeepSeek R1, were the first publicly known group of humanoid robots deployed as a coordinated team to carry out a wide range of tasks in a complex, real-world industrial setting. 1 Just a few months later, UBTech unveiled the Walker S2, the world’s first humanoid robot capable of autonomously changing its own batteries—potentially enabling uninterrupted, twenty-four-hour operation on the factory floor without any human assistance. 2  These demonstrations offer a glimpse into leading Chinese companies’ ability to translate frontier AI capabilities into useful real-world industrial applications. More significantly, these private sector achievements have become central to Beijing’s evolving national AI strategy, which seeks to leverage China’s combined strengths in AI software and robotics hardware to achieve a distinctive form of technological leadership. While Washington and most of Silicon Valley focus primarily on scaling large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and digital AI applications, Beijing has placed a fundamentally different bet. It believes that true AI dominance will come from systems capable of autonomous operation in the physical world—AI-powered robotics, commonly known as embodied AI. To achieve its ambitions in embodied AI, the Chinese government is rolling out a familiar technological development playbook: encouraging local governments to experiment with different approaches to develop and scale the technology. In response to Beijing’s call, provinces are channeling investment into local companies working on AI systems that can learn from human workers on factory floors, navigate complex physical environments, and bridge the gap between digital reasoning and real-world action. If China can achieve its vision, embodied AI could potentially solve some of China’s most pressing domestic challenges, including turbocharging its sluggish economy and addressing social challenges like its aging population. It could also yield a broad-based set of strategic advantages. Building a mature embodied AI ecosystem and securing durable global leadership in this area could, in theory, form a key pillar of China’s future economic and military power, and place it ahead in the global race toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). But how does China plan to do this, and what obstacles stand in the way? This paper addresses that question by examining how the Chinese government conceives of embodied AI, the steps it is taking to advance it, and the ecosystem’s strengths and weaknesses. The paper also sheds light on how progress in embodied AI could reshape China’s economy, strengthen its national competitiveness, and impact the world. What Is Embodied AI? In both the West and China, embodied AI is generally understood as AI-powered hardware systems that can perceive and interpret multimodal inputs from the physical environment, including by sight, sound, and touch. They make autonomous decisions, carry out physical actions in the real world, and learn from those interactions. 3  Embodied AI is generally understood as AI-powered hardware systems that can perceive and interpret multimodal inputs from the physical environment, including by sight, sound, and touch. Importantly, while embodied AI is often associated with humanoid robots, which mimic the appearance and functions of humans, the two are not synonymous. Humanoids are machines defined by their human-like physical appearance, but their functional capabilities vary greatly depending on their software, sensing, and control systems. In practice, many humanoid robots remain limited-purpose systems, only capable of performing narrowly defined tasks, such as sitting at a reception desk and waving at visitors. The defining feature of embodied AI systems, on the other hand, does not lie in their physical form (see figure 1). These systems can take multiple physical forms, with humanoid robots being only one example; others include quadrupeds, drones, autonomous vehicles, industrial manipulators, and microbots. Industrial robots, for example, have long automated repetitive work on assembly lines even without generative AI. What defines embodied AI systems instead are their capabilities. They integrate advanced software, sophisticated sensors, and intricate control systems that enable a high degree of autonomous decisionmaking, adaptability to dynamic environments, and the ability to perform diverse tasks—for instance, completing all stages of a car production line traditionally handled by human workers.   Embodied AI systems are typically equipped with a rich set of sensors and are powered by multimodal AI models that support perception, reasoning, and action. These models typically draw on the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using them as the linguistic and reasoning backbone to which vision- and action-modules are added.  Embodied AI systems stand apart for their ability not only to interpret data but also to interact with and adapt to diverse physical environments. This sets them apart from conventional applications, in which AI enhances mostly single-purpose tools and services, such as CT diagnostic assistants or weather prediction models. It also distinguishes them from software-based “agents,” which act purely in digital environments. 4 In practice, embodied AI has fuzzy boundaries and is more of a spectrum than a singular, easily recognized threshold. The lower end of this spectrum, comprising systems capable of performing a limited range of real-world tasks, such as UBTech’s Walker S2, has already been developed. However, neither China nor the West have achieved the fully autonomous systems grounded in continuously updated world models that some imagine as the foundation for embodied AGI. Western and Chinese research communities differ in the amount of attention and resources they are allocating to studying embodied AI. In the United States, most interest in embodied AI appears to be confined to the private sector. Big tech players such as Tesla, with its autonomous vehicles and smart robot Optimus, are making substantial investments in embodied AI. 5 Meanwhile, emerging companies such as Figure AI, which produces general-purpose humanoid robots, are also gaining traction, securing substantial external funding. 6 By contrast, in China, enthusiasm for embodied AI extends well beyond the private sector. Since the beginning of this year, the country’s expert community has witnessed a rapid surge of interest in embodied AI, with the topic rapidly gaining prominence in both policy and academic discussions. 7 Embodied AI: A Physical World Extension into the Real Economy The rise of embodied AI in Chinese policy discourse has not emerged in a vacuum. China’s embodied AI push reflects a deliberate effort by the government to translate advances in generative AI from the purely digital realm into what Beijing frequently refers to as the real economy: sectors encompassing the production of tangible goods and essential services that underpin economic activity in the physical world. In so doing, China hopes to revitalize its economy amid recent slow economic growth. 8  China’s embodied AI push reflects a deliberate effort by the government to translate advances in generative AI from the purely digital realm into what Beijing frequently refers to as the real economy. The idea that the real economy constitutes the foundation of China’s economic strength and must therefore be the primary focus of domestic AI adoption is deeply rooted in President Xi Jinping’s economic thought. Xi’s views on the economy were shaped in part by lessons from the 2008 global financial crisis. According to an analysis by the Chinese Communist Party’s Institute of Party History and Literature, the crisis exposed the risks of excessive reliance on the virtual economy—nonphysical forms of economic activity such as financial services and digital platforms. 9 Since becoming party general secretary in 2012, Xi has repeatedly called for the deep integration (深度融合) of the digital economy with the real economy, 10 which he regards as the key to China’s long-term growth. 11 Therefore, when the release of DeepSeek’s R1 model in January 2025 made it clear that China’s capabilities in AI were becoming increasingly mature, 12 the party likely concluded that the time had come to transition AI into the real economy. This conclusion was likely reinforced by the pressing need to revive economic growth amid China’s property-market crisis, sluggish domestic consumption, and the beginnings of population decline. 13 Building on China’s earlier advances in hardware systems such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and drones, Beijing sought to leverage embodied AI as one of the key tools to facilitate this transition. The party’s emerging focus on embodied AI has crystallized across several important reports and speeches after the DeepSeek moment. The March 2025 annual Government Work Report identified embodied AI alongside biomanufacturing, quantum technologies, and 6G as core tools for building the industries of the future. 14 While embodied AI has emerged as a new focus, the party has made clear that LLMs remain an important, complementary element of Beijing’s AI agenda. For example, Premier Li Qiang’s July 2025 keynote speech at the World AI Conference highlighted embodied AI alongside LLMs as areas of AI currently experiencing major breakthroughs. 15 Most recently, the CCP Central Committee recommended incorporating embodied AI as one of the new drivers of economic growth in China’s forthcoming 15th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. 16 The Central Committee’s decision offers the clearest indication to date that the CCP leadership intends to place a long-term strategic bet on embodied AI, expecting it to play a defining role in shaping China’s future. What Beijing Hopes to Achieve with Embodied AI Embodied AI could help Chinese leadership achieve five concrete goals across three key dimensions: domestic, strategic, and comprehensive (see figure 2). Domestically, embodied AI could help address structural economic and demographic challenges. Strategically, it could strengthen China’s position amid global technological and geopolitical competition. Its third objective is crosscutting: achieving AGI in its truest form by creating general AI fully capable of autonomously interacting in the physical world.   Goal 1: Catalyze Economic Growth Domestically, Beijing seeks to use the development and deployment of embodied AI to significantly boost productivity in key industries, such as manufacturing and logistics, that are critical to revitalizing China’s slowing economic growth. This goal is articulated in the 2024 “Report on the Development of Embodied AI” co-authored by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), 17 a research body under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The report’s authors note that embodied AI could be leveraged to revolutionize human-machine collaboration, enabling autonomous hardware systems to learn from human coworkers through natural language interfacing, gestures, and motion. CAICT imagines potentially transformative economic impact and claims that over time these systems could replace humans as the most flexible units on industrial production lines, significantly boosting productivity. Goal 2: Address Aging Population Additionally, the CAICT report identifies embodied AI as a means of addressing China’s rapidly aging population that is expected to pose a serious challenge to the country’s economic growth. Embodied AI systems could substitute for human labor in roles typically affected by worker shortages due to the undesirable or hazardous nature of the tasks, such as those that might expose people to extreme temperatures. They could also provide eldercare services, thereby easing the burden on working-age individuals who, according to Chinese cultural norms, would otherwise be responsible for caring for aging family members. Goal 3: Strengthen the Military In addition to its role in advancing the AI frontier, Beijing also regards embodied AI as a technology capable of significantly enhancing the country’s military capabilities. The official news outlet of China’s People’s Liberation Army, PLA Daily , assesses that embodied AI could help China overcome human physiological limitations, redefine the boundaries of unmanned warfare, and give rise to a more agile and efficient combat system. 18 It envisions embodied AI systems that integrate multimodal sensors—such as vision, sound, touch, and even smell—with large multimodal models to autonomously observe their environment, make decisions, and act on the battlefield. Unlike current unmanned systems, which generally still require varying levels of human involvement, these embodied AI systems would offer a much higher degree of real-time tactical autonomy, making them significantly more resilient to electronic warfare interference. They would no longer be mere order executors, but commander-fighters capable of making adjustments in response to changing battlefield conditions. Goal 4: Gain Geoeconomic Advantage In addition to addressing economic and societal challenges, embodied AI could provide the Chinese government with substantial geoeconomic advantages. If Beijing effectively leverages its vast manufacturing capacity, it could emerge as the world’s leading supplier of embodied AI systems—creating a level of dependence on Chinese technology that might surpass earlier global reliance on emerging technologies such as 5G networks or solar panels. Unlike those technologies, embodied AI has the potential to become a foundational tool for automating a wide spectrum of physical tasks across the global economy, meaning that access to such systems could ultimately determine a country’s future economic competitiveness. Recognizing these stakes, Beijing has already begun laying the institutional groundwork for the global diffusion of embodied AI. Through its recent Global AI Governance Action Plan and AI+ International Cooperation Initiative, 19 China has sought to position itself as the partner best equipped to deliver practical AI applications tailored to the development needs of other countries. It has also announced the creation of a new platform for sharing these applications, the World AI Cooperation Organization (WAICO). 20 While China is currently concentrating on exporting more general AI applications, once embodied AI matures, it could use these established diffusion channels to spread the technology globally—even if it faces real economic constraints. Goal 5: Achieve AGI In addition to addressing domestic challenges, some key Chinese thought leaders see embodied AI as a means of accelerating the country’s frontier AI capabilities.  For example, the CAICT report argues that embodied AI could help advance the ambition of achieving AGI.  The view that embodied AI offers the most promising path toward AGI is echoed by influential Chinese scholars such as Zhang Bo, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor at Tsinghua University. 21 Zhang argues that while LLMs have laid a crucial foundation for AGI by enabling machines to understand and generate human language, it is embodied AI that will ultimately allow AI to replicate the full spectrum of human capabilities. He attributes this to embodied AI’s ability to interact with and learn from the physical world, which he sees as essential for achieving true general intelligence. 22  What the Chinese Government is Doing to Make It Happen By listing embodied AI among its key priorities in this year’s Government Work Report, the Chinese leadership has indicated that it is determined to accelerate its development. The government hopes to encourage academia and local authorities to explore and pilot potential development strategies that could later be scaled up nationally. This “pilot first, scale later” approach is not new—it has long been an important tool in Beijing’s innovation policy implementation. It was first employed in the 1980s by Deng Xiaoping during the Reform and Opening Up period, when he established special economic zones in cities like Shenzhen, allowing local governments to experiment with market-oriented reforms before scaling the most successful policies nationwide. 23 More recently, the People’s Bank of China adopted this approach for digital currency deployment, launching pilot programs in cities such as Hangzhou and Shenzhen to test the use of the digital renminbi (RMB) with a view toward a nationwide rollout in the future. 24  Following the government’s encouragement, embodied AI has become the subject of an increasing number of scholarly discussions, exhibitions, and conferences across China. One notable example is the annual China Embodied AI Conference, co-organized by the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence and major Chinese universities active in AI and robotics research and talent development, such as Tsinghua and Tongji. 25 Its second annual meeting, held in 2025, culminated in the publication “15 Key Research Directions in Embodied Intelligence,” which highlighted priorities such as multimodal embodied perception, embodied world model construction, and embodied AI safety. 26 This document, reportedly the first systematic roadmap for embodied AI development in China, is poised to provide the government with a clearer sense of priorities in future funding allocation. Various Chinese provincial and municipal governments have sought to position themselves as pioneers for future nationwide policy. At the same time, various Chinese provincial and municipal governments have sought to position themselves as pioneers for future nationwide policy. Many have launched their own initiatives, but a few stand out due to the scale, ambition, and visibility of their efforts. In particular, the authorities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hubei—who are traditionally among the wealthiest in China and have a strong track record of spearheading development of emerging industries through ambitious policy initiatives—have so far taken the lead. 27 These regions have adopted diverse approaches to shaping the development of embodied AI, varying both in their emphasis on different segments of the production chain and in the strategies used to incentivize and support local industry. They have also sought to allocate resources more strategically, focusing on areas of embodied AI development where local companies already hold a relative advantage. For example, Beijing, home to one of China’s leading AI chip developers, Cambricon, 28 has prioritized elements such as high-performance chips tailored for embodied AI applications. 29 Shanghai—headquarters of Hesai Technology, 30 a national leader in sensor technologies for autonomous vehicles—has concentrated on core hardware components. 31  At the same time, governments in Guangdong and Zhejiang have focused on complete embodied AI platforms, specifically multipurpose humanoid robotics. These regions already hold a competitive edge with companies such as Shenzhen-based UBTech Robotics and Hangzhou-based Unitree Robotics leading private sector developments in the embodied AI field. Meanwhile, the Hubei provincial government has focused its efforts on another niche of embodied AI platforms: smart vehicles. It has leveraged the resources of local Dongfeng Motor—one of China’s largest car manufacturers—and established the Laboratory for Embodied Intelligence Technology in Automobiles. 32 To support these efforts, the provincial governments have pledged varying levels of funding. For instance, Beijing has launched a 100 billion RMB (approximately $14.3 billion) investment fund with a fifteen-year lifespan to support AI and robotics. 33 Meanwhile, Shanghai has established an embodied AI fund, with an initial closing of 560 million RMB (approximately $77 million). 34 However, this largely devolved, local government-driven strategy is not without downsides. While provinces appear to be attempting to specialize in different segments of embodied AI, the lack of detailed guidance from Beijing risks leading to duplication of efforts and misallocation of resources. A parallel can be drawn with the electric vehicle sector. Fierce inter-provincial competition and overinvestment in local manufacturers produced staggering levels of economic waste and industrial overcapacity. 35 Yet the evolution of China’s world-leading EV industry also demonstrates that this seemingly wasteful competition can, over time, generate genuine technological breakthroughs. As with EVs, local government efforts in embodied AI could foster the rise of national champions and provide Beijing with clearer models of how to scale emerging technologies that can later be replicated at the national level. Ultimately, whether the approach of devolving the initial development of embodied AI to local governments succeeds will depend on several factors. First, national success likely hinges on local governments effectively dividing responsibility across different segments of the embodied AI supply chain and avoiding excessive duplication. Second, success will also depend on whether sufficient and sustainable financing will be available to support the long-term growth of local embodied AI companies. The latter may prove difficult given the substantial debt many local governments have accumulated over the past decade. This debt was driven by provincial governments responding to Beijing’s national growth targets, which encouraged heavy borrowing for investment in infrastructure and manufacturing such as electric vehicles, regardless of returns. 36 Third, technological advances could plateau, and fundamental breakthroughs could be limited. Whether embodied AI systems will ultimately match the dexterity, adaptability, and efficiency of human workers remains uncertain and could take far longer than many current industrial plans assume. 37 Where The Industry Stands and Where It Is Headed While the role of academia and local governments is crucial, Beijing’s bet on embodied AI ultimately hinges on the industry’s ability to deliver breakthroughs that will make the technology cost-effective and scalable. That effort is already well underway. National champions are already emerging across key sectors in China’s embodied AI industry: Unitree and UBTech in humanoid robotics, 38 DJI in drones, 39 and Baidu Apollo and XPeng in autonomous vehicles. 40 In each of these cases, industry-driven capabilities in robotics, manufacturing, and EVs formed the foundation for integrating AI into existing company infrastructures. China’s advantage in embodied AI lies in its robust hardware manufacturing base and supply chain, which could position it to rapidly scale production once the technology matures. Compared to the rest of the world, China’s advantage in embodied AI lies in its robust hardware manufacturing base and supply chain, which could position it to rapidly scale production once the technology matures. 41 This includes cost-effective manufacturing of embodied AI hardware platforms such as robots and drones, as well as some key components of embodied AI systems, such as LiDAR, the sensor technology essential for 3D mapping and environmental navigation. 42 As the world’s largest manufacturer, China also holds a competitive edge in the diversity and abundance of real-world application scenarios, which generate rich datasets critical for training embodied AI systems—many of which are intended for use in production lines. 43 However, Chinese developers often struggle to access this data, prompting some industry leaders to call on the government to grant companies access to datasets held by government agencies and state-owned enterprises. 44  Much like the rest of the world, China’s embodied AI technology remains at a relatively early stage, with the industry still lacking a complete commercial cycle. It largely remains confined to R&D, small-batch production, and pilot applications in specific scenarios, with key components such as balance and motion control software still under development. 45  However, major industry players are increasingly pushing to accelerate large-scale production and deployment. UBTech, for instance, recently secured a 250 million RMB (approximately $35 million) order for its Walker S2 industrial humanoid robots from an undisclosed domestic company. 46 China’s comparative weaknesses, on the other hand, include limited access to advanced AI chips and compute for both training and inference of models used in embodied AI systems. It still trails the West, though it is making steady progress. 47 Another key limitation lies in multidimensional sensors, such as torque sensors and six-axis force sensors for high-precision force measurement and perception in embodied AI systems, where China still relies heavily on Western imports. 48  Despite these limitations, most Chinese experts and industry leaders believe that the country’s existing advantages, combined with steady progress in lagging areas and sustained government support, could enable steady technological progress in embodied AI within the next five to ten years. 49 This progress would culminate in the development and deployment of AI systems capable of performing physical work in real-economy settings, advancing Xi Jinping’s conceptual objective for the use of AI in the real economy. 50 Meanwhile, some Chinese experts, such as Huang Tiejun, Director of the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence—one of China’s leading AI labs working on embodied AI—have made longer-term predictions. Huang has suggested that embodied AI could fully surpass human capabilities by 2045. 51  Conclusion Beijing is making a long-term strategic bet on embodied AI, viewing it as a potential solution to many of China’s economic, social, and geopolitical challenges. Yet, whether this gambit succeeds, and in what ways, remains uncertain. Technological breakthroughs may prove elusive, and high levels of local debt could constrain sustained investment. Nevertheless, Chinese leadership appears determined to push forward, committing substantial political will and financial resources to make embodied AI a viable and scalable technology. Should Beijing develop fully commercially applicable embodied AI systems ahead of other countries, it would likely leverage its comparative advantages—a robust manufacturing base, comprehensive supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of factories where robots are likely to be deployed in the future—to rapidly scale up production and position itself as a dominant player in the global embodied AI systems market. In such a scenario, the world could depend on Chinese embodied AI technologies across critical economic sectors, including manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and service industries. It would also greatly strengthen China’s capabilities in autonomous warfare, potentially influencing the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific and beyond—especially if China chooses to export military applications of embodied AI to countries such as Russia. And if embodied AI ultimately holds the key to unlocking true AGI, Beijing could hold a decisive edge in its frontier AI rivalry with Washington. How the United States responds to this challenge will not just determine the trajectory of AI development but also shape the balance of economic and military power in the decades ahead.

research with real-world manufacturing systems   SHANGHAI , Nov. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- AgiBot, a robotics company specializing in embodied intelligence, announced a key milestone with the successful deployment of its Real-World Reinforcement Learning (RW-RL) system on a pilot production line with Longcheer Technology. The project marks the first application of real-world reinforcement learning in real industrial robotics, connecting advanced AI innovation with large-scale production and signaling a new phase in the evolution of intelligent automation for precision manufacturing.    Continue Reading                                              Tackling the Core Challenges of Flexible Manufacturing   Precision manufacturing lines have long relied on rigid automation systems that demand complex fixture design, extensive tuning, and costly reconfiguration. Even advanced "vision + force-control" solutions have struggled with parameter sensitivity, long deployment cycles, and maintenance complexity. AgiBot''s Real-World Reinforcement Learning system addresses these long-standing pain points by enabling robots to learn and adapt directly on the factory floor. Within just tens of minutes, robots can acquire new skills, achieve stable deployment, and maintain long-term performance without degradation. During line changes or model transitions, only minimal hardware adjustments and standardized deployment steps are required, dramatically improving flexibility while cutting time and cost.  Core Advantages of AgiBot''s Real-World Reinforcement Learning   Rapid Deployment — Training time for new skills is reduced from weeks to minutes, achieving exponential gains in efficiency.  High Adaptability — The system autonomously compensates for common variations such as part position and tolerance shifts, maintaining industrial-grade stability and a 100% task completion rate over extended operation.  Flexible Reconfiguration — Task or product changes can be accommodated through fast retraining, without custom fixtures or tooling, overcoming the long-standing "rigid automation vs. variable demand" dilemma in consumer electronics manufacturing.The solution exhibits generality across workspace layouts and production lines, allowing quick transfer and reuse across diverse industrial scenarios. This milestone signifies a deep integration between perception-decision intelligence and motion control , representing a critical step toward unifying algorithmic intelligence and physical execution.  The solution exhibits strong generality across workspace layouts and production lines, allowing quick transfer and reuse across diverse industrial scenarios. This milestone signifies a deep integration between perception-decision intelligence and motion control—representing a crucial step toward unifying algorithmic intelligence and physical execution. Unlike many laboratory demonstrations, AgiBot''s system was validated under near-production conditions, completing the full loop from cutting-edge research to industrial-grade verification.  From Research Breakthrough to Industrial Reality  In recent years, the robotics and AI research community has made significant progress in advancing reinforcement learning toward greater stability, efficiency, and real-world applicability. Building on these advances, Dr. Jianlan Luo,  Chief Scientist at Agibot, and his team have contributed key academic breakthroughs demonstrating that reinforcement learning can achieve reliable and high-performance results directly on physical robots. At AgiBot, this foundation evolved into a deployable real-world reinforcement learning system, integrating advanced algorithms with control and hardware stacks. The system achieves stable, repeatable learning on real machines—marking an important step in bridging academic research and industrial deployment.  Expanding Real-World Applications  The validation has now been successfully demonstrated on a pilot production line in collaboration with Longcheer Technology. Moving forward, AgiBot and Longcheer plan to extend real-world reinforcement learning to a broader range of precision manufacturing scenarios, including consumer electronics and automotive components. The focus will be on developing modular, rapidly deployable robot solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing production systems.

Photograph: Eli Hartman/Getty Images Comment Loader Save Story Save this story Comment Loader Save Story Save this story Are self-driving vehicles really just big, remote-controlled cars, with nameless and faceless people in far-off call centers piloting the things from behind consoles? As the vehicles and their science-fiction-like software expand to more cities, the conspiracy theory has rocketed around group chats and TikToks. It’s been powered, in part, by the reluctance of self-driving car companies to talk in specifics about the humans who help make their robots go. But this month, in government documents submitted by Alphabet subsidiary Waymo and electric-auto maker Tesla , the companies have revealed more details about the people and programs that help the vehicles when their software gets confused. The details of these companies'' “remote assistance” programs are important because the humans supporting the robots are critical in ensuring the cars are driving safely on public roads, industry experts say. Even robotaxis that run smoothly most of the time get into situations that their self-driving systems find perplexing. See, for example, a December power outage in San Francisco that killed stop lights around the city, stranding confused Waymos in several intersections. Or the ongoing government  probes into several instances of these cars illegally blowing past stopped school buses unloading students in Austin, Texas. (The latter led Waymo to issue a software recall. ) When this happens, humans get the cars out of the jam by directing or “advising” them from afar. These jobs are important because if people do them wrong, they can be the difference between, say, a car stopping for or running a red light. “For the foreseeable future, there will be people who play a role in the vehicles’ behavior, and therefore have a safety role to play,” says Philip Koopman, an autonomous-vehicle software and safety researcher at Carnegie Mellon University. One of the hardest safety problems associated with self-driving, he says, is building software that knows when to ask for human help. In other words: If you care about robot safety, pay attention to the people. The People of Waymo Waymo operates a paid robotaxi service in six metros—Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area—and has plans to launch in at least 10 more, including London , this year. Now, in a blog post and letter submitted to US senator Ed Markey this week, the company made public more aspects of what it calls its “remote assistance” (RA) program, which uses remote workers to respond to requests from Waymo’s vehicle software when it determines it needs help. These humans give data or advice to the systems, writes Ryan McNamara, Waymo''s vice president and global head of operations. The system can use or reject the information that humans provide. “Waymo’s RA agents provide advice and support to the Waymo Driver but do not directly control, steer, or drive the vehicle,” McNamara writes—denying, implicitly, the charge that Waymos are simply remote-controlled cars. About 70 assistants are on duty at any given time to monitor some 3,000 robotaxis, the company says. The low ratio indicates the cars are doing much of the heavy lifting. Waymo also confirmed in its letter what an executive told Congress in a hearing earlier this month: Half of these remote assistance workers are contractors overseas, in the Philippines. (The company says it has two other remote assistance offices in Arizona and Michigan.) These workers are licensed to drive in the Philippines, McNamara writes, but are trained on US road rules. All remote assistance workers are drug- and alcohol-tested when they are hired, the company says, and 45 percent are drug-tested every three months as part of Waymo’s random testing program. The company says a highly trained US-based team handles the most complex remote interactions, including collisions, contacts with law enforcement and riders, and interactions with regulatory agencies. The company declined to comment beyond the details in its letter. Tesla’s Human Babysitters Tesla has operated a small robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, since last June . The service started with human safety monitors sitting in the vehicles’ front passenger seats , ready to intervene if the tech went wrong. Last month, CEO Elon Musk said the company had started to take these monitors out of the front seats. He acknowledged that while the company did use “chase cars” to monitor and intervene with the software, it had started to operate some cars without that more direct human intervention. (A larger but still limited Tesla ride-hailing service in the Bay Area operates with human drivers behind the wheel .) But the company has not revealed much about the people who help its vehicles out of jams, or how they do the job. Now, in a filing submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission this week, Tesla AI technical program manager Dzuy Cao writes that Tesla runs two offices of “remote operators,” based in Austin and the Bay Area. (In a seeming dig at Waymo’s Philippines revelations, Cao emphasizes that it “requires that its remote operators be located domestically.”) The company says these operators undergo “extensive” background checks and drug and alcohol testing, and have valid US driver’s licenses. But Tesla still hasn’t revealed how often these operators intervene with its self-driving technology, and exactly how they do it. Tesla didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment. The details of these remote programs could determine whether self-driving cars actually keep others on the road out of harm’s way. “If there’s a person who can make a mistake that can result in or contribute to a crash, then you have a safety issue you have to deal with,” Koopman says.

This column reveals five key findings from a new database covering China''s WTO subsidy notifications from 2001 to 2022: (1) direct fiscal support stabilised around 0.8% of GDP after 2008; (2) China is an active subsidy user with striking policy persistence; (3) FDI-promoting subsidies have declined while industry-specific and innovation-focused support has risen; (4) wealthier, more open provinces provide more local subsidies; and (5) agriculture dominates by value while manufacturing subsidies are modest. These patterns reveal how China''s subsidy strategy has evolved from attracting foreign capital towards technological self-reliance.    Authors                       Shuhui Xiang                         Xinran Yin                         Yuan Zi             Share        Twitter         Facebook         LinkedIn         Bluesky              China''s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse has been accompanied by persistent debates about the role of government intervention (e.g. Aghion et al. 2015). While certain policies, such as tariffs and FDI regulations, are well documented, systematic evidence on China''s broader industrial subsidy landscape has remained elusive. This gap matters: subsidies are among the most direct and powerful tools governments use to shape economic activity, and understanding China''s approach is essential not only for trade and development policy, but also for debates on geopolitics, industrial competition, and technology security.  In a recent paper (Xiang et al. 2025), we address this gap by digitising and analysing China''s official subsidy notifications to the WTO from 2001 to 2022. This represents the first systematic, non-estimated dataset of Chinese industrial subsidies based on authoritative government sources. The database covers 1,256 unique programmes – 260 at the central level and 996 at the local level – including direct financial appropriations, grants, interest-discount programmes, and tax incentives. After cross-checking notifications against original domestic documents, we document five findings.  Fact 1: Subsidies incidence has expanded, but direct fiscal support stabilised  China''s subsidy incidence has increased over time, with the number of active programmes rising from 85 in 2001 to 446 in 2022. However, the post-2015 jump largely reflects a change in reporting methodology, as China began including sub-central programmes following an EU request – though local subsidies amount to only a fraction of central government support (Figure 1a).  More telling is the trajectory of subsidy values, as shown in Figure 1b. Direct fiscal support rose sharply after 2004 – coinciding with a major expansion of rural support policies – peaked around 2008, and has since stabilised at approximately 0.8% of GDP. This figure aligns broadly with OECD estimates and suggests that while China remains an active user of subsidies, the scale of direct budgetary support has not continued to escalate.  Figure 1 Annual trends in Chinese subsidies               Note : Panel (a) reports the yearly count of central and, from 2015 onward, local subsidies. Panel (b) shows their total value, with the line chart indicating subsidy values as a share of GDP (right axis).  Fact 2: China subsidises more than its development level predicts, with remarkable policy persistence  As shown in Figure 2a, comparing subsidy notifications across WTO members reveals a notable pattern: plotting the number of subsidies against GDP per capita in 2019–2020, China (and the US) employs far more programmes than its income levels would suggest.  While some less developed countries may underreport their subsidy practices, even more notable is the persistence of Chinese programmes visualized in Figure 2b. The average central subsidy programme lasts more than ten years, with approximately 10% persisting for 20 years or longer. This durability reflects a long-term strategic approach where subsidies function as sustained investments rather than temporary interventions, pointing to strong institutional commitment and policy continuity across political cycles.  Figure 2 Duration and number of subsidies               Note : Panel (a) plots the number of subsidies against GDP per capita in 2019, with variables shown on a logarithmic scale and axis labels reported in levels. Panel (b) plots the duration of Chinese central subsidy programs active between 2001 and 2022.  Fact 3: From FDI promotion to technological self-reliance  The objectives of Chinese subsidies have shifted markedly over two decades. As depicted in Figure 3, programmes promoting foreign direct investment accounted for nearly 10% of central government subsidies in 2001 but declined to just 3.3% by 2022. Conversely, industry-specific subsidies more than doubled, rising from 7.9% to 16.3% over the same period. Innovation and technology have consistently received a sizeable share of subsidies.  Figure 3 Changes in objectives, 2001 vs 2022               Note : Panels (a) and (b) report central government subsidy incidence in 2001 and 2022, respectively. Percentages indicate each objective’s share of total subsidies for the given year and government level.  This reallocation reflects China''s strategic pivot from trade and FDI liberalisation towards technological self-reliance and industrial sovereignty. Viewed in this light, the earlier openness to foreign investment may have been an intermediate stage rather than an end in itself. The timing and scale of this shift both responds to and helps explain intensifying trade and technology tensions with Western economies.  Fact 4: Wealthier, more open provinces subsidise more  The data also allow us to examine sub-central subsidies reported since 2015. In Figure 4, we find that wealthier and more trade-oriented provinces provide significantly more local government support. This pattern suggests that local subsidies may reinforce rather than reduce regional disparities within China. It mirrors broader fiscal disparities, as the richest regions spend several times more per capita than the poorest.  Figure 4 Number of subsidies and local government indicators               Note : Panel (a) plots average number of subsidies (2015–2022) against average GDP per capita (2010–2014), and Panel (b) against trade openness across 31 provinces. Both variables are shown on a logarithmic scale with pre-log axis labels.  Fact 5: Agricultural subsidies dominate by value  Finally, Figure 5 suggests that measuring subsidy by count versus value yields a very different picture. By programme count, scientific research, agriculture, and manufacturing are the most frequently subsidised sectors. However, the value distribution tells a different story. Agriculture dominates, receiving nearly 40 trillion RMB over 21 years – approximately 47% of total funds. Construction ranks second, reflecting China''s emphasis on infrastructure investment.  Figure 5 Subsidies by sectors               Note : Panel (a) reports each sector’s share of the total number of subsidies, and Panel (b) reports each sector’s share of total subsidy value.  Notably, direct manufacturing subsidies are relatively modest, both in total value and per-programme terms. On average, a manufacturing subsidy is less than twice the size of one for R&D and under 1/20th the size of one for agriculture. China''s decentralised, small-scale support for manufacturing contrasts with perceptions of large-scale ''big push'' interventions. This pattern aligns more closely with recent research emphasising incremental approaches to technological upgrading (Juhász et al. 2024) and flexible policy toolkits (Bloom et al. 2019).  Conclusion  Our analysis of China''s official subsidy notifications reveals a more nuanced picture than typically portrayed in policy debates. While China is indeed an active user of industrial subsidies, direct fiscal support has stabilised since 2008. The strategic focus has shifted decisively from attracting foreign investment towards promoting domestic innovation and technological capabilities. Manufacturing subsidies, contrary to common perception, are relatively modest and decentralised.  These findings carry implications for both trade policy and development economics. For trading partners concerned about Chinese subsidies, the data suggest focusing on the evolving objectives rather than just the scale of support. For developing countries looking to China''s experience, the evidence points to sustained, flexible approaches rather than one-off interventions.  We hope this database, along with other recent efforts (Juhász et al. 2022, Fang et al. 2025), will enable further research on industrial policy, including comparative analyses with other countries and systematic evaluations of subsidy effectiveness.
